"Anonymous",44,"90001400807","Common Ground High School","358 Springside Ave.","New Haven","Connecticut","New Haven Ecology Project","http://www.commongroundct.org","Public charter school",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"CBO School - School within a community nonprofit organization.","Multiple",1,1,0,1,0,NA,"Common Ground has planted the seeds of a student-centered model of urban public high school education that leverages the larger learning ecosystem to help all students succeed in and beyond high school. We are growing these seeds into an integrated, responsive, student-centered, community-rooted model of urban public secondary education.  What if all 9th and 10th graders experienced a rich set of interdisciplinary, community-based learning experiences, culminating in performances and products for real audiences? What if our students’ 9th and 10th grade experiences were built to help them navigate and succeed in learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom, preparing them for more independent work in junior and senior years?   In 9th grade, as students are first finding Common Ground, their experiences starts close to home -- focused on their own identity, our 20-acre campus, and their place in our community.  The year starts with an immersion in Common Ground’s urban farm, and in questions related to this place -- how we feed ourselves and meet our other basic needs, how we build a food system is fair and just, how energy flows through our food system, what math tells us about what Common Ground’s urban farm should grow. Students move from this focus on basic needs to a study of how to survive and thrive in a diverse community, and then  explore how we create positive change in the places we call home. Each unit culminates in a real performance for a public audience: presenting a variety of work at a family food night, for instance. Through these experiences, students make measurable and significant growth as readers, writers, and problem-solvers -- and gain the skills they need to navigate and advocate in a variety of learning settings. Because a team of teachers share these new students and the curriculum is built to help students share their experiences, teachers can be responsive to the young people in front of them.   In 10th grade, students turn from their own campus and identity to the City of New Haven as a whole.  Four integrated units -- New Haven Stories, Justice & Change, Climate & Power, and Community Health -- push students to explore the systems and dynamics that have shaped our city, and how they can help to create a more just and sustainable community. Student venture out into the city throughout each unit -- connecting with neighborhood leaders, exploring neighborhood change, helping policymakers develop solutions to real problems -- and community members regularly push in to roles as co-teachers. Again, each unit challenges students to synthesize and share their learning for an authentic audience: building a website and photo essay about their New Haven stories, producing an original piece of theater that enacts and intervenes in injustice, creating public art that helps address climate change, producing video public service announcements that help create a healthier community. The expectations of students ramp up, as they prepare to take greater control of their educational path in grades 11 and 12.   These experiences will be grounded in a common set of design principles, co-created by Common Ground students and teachers -- the foundational building blocks of teaching and learning at Common Ground. Through extended units of study, students will tackle questions and problems that hit close to home – relevant and responsive to their own lives, and the communities and cultures they call home. These interdisciplinary units will integrate core disciplinary standards and teachers from math, science, ELA, and social studies into a deep learning experience that takes up half of students’ school day. Through start-of-unit expeditions, ongoing field work, and culminating performances for public audiences, students will experience and develop skills for navigating a larger learning ecosystem. These experiences will also be designed to build students’ capacity as leaders, change agents, and social justice advocates – rooted in Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework.  Students will have real and growing voice and agency about what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate learning – and universal design will support the participation of all students.   What if all juniors and seniors were able to curate their own learning plan, with support from their academic advisors, integrating college courses, work experiences, internships, elective courses, and core academic offerings?   As students move into their last two years of high school, they will take increasing control of their own education. A core junior seminar will ground their experience, in which they will build skills for action research, explore college and career options, and identify expanded learning opportunities that match their interests. The following year, a Senior Environmental Justice Capstone will support students as they refine college essays, conduct college-level research on social and environmental challenges, take on capstone projects that address these challenges, and prepare to defend their leadership portfolios.    We know, as well, that core academic classes will form a key part of every student’s schedule, and that these courses will include opportunities for community-based field work, culminating performances for public audiences, and learning that is tied to college, career, and community leadership. We are fully committed to a vertically aligned, scaffolded experience in the core subjects that ensures that all students graduate college-ready.   In the context of these anchor experiences, the junior and senior experience will consistently blur the line between school and the larger community, between school day and out-of-school time. All of our juniors and seniors will participate in a combination of early college courses, work-based learning opportunities, internships, and credit-bearing out-of-school opportunities. Many will travel to Southern Connecticut State University, just around the corner from Common Ground’s campus, for a part of their school day. Community organizations will push into the school day and building in more robust ways, as well; for instance, the education director from a local theater company teaches a course on using devised theater methodologies to confront social justice challenges. Students will earn credit by documenting learning in out-of-school programs, work placements, and internships.  Some students will develop their own learning experiences from the ground up.  The mix of these types of experiences vary from student to student. Some will opt for more traditional high school experiences, while others will participate more in the wider learning ecosystem.    What if experiences through Green Jobs Corps, Common Ground’s urban farm and community programs, and out-of-school opportunities were intentionally connected with academic classes, so that students had a chance to practice skills and understandings developed in their courses in the workplace and other out-of-school settings? What if all students built and explored their own pathways through their four years of high school, integrating experiences in a wide range of learning environments?     Some students will choose to blaze their own pathways, while others will find one that’s well trodden already. The farm immersion unit in the 9th grade core prepares students for a community-based exploration of food justice and access in the 10th grade core. Students can choose to dive deeper into these questions through an elective course on food justice, perhaps leading into a farm internship, a paid work opportunity through our Green Jobs Corps, farm-based after-school programs, and/or a senior project.  Students will explore pathways to college, as well. Every 9th grader makes it onto the campus of Southern Connecticut State University  -- touring campus, participating in workshops led by undergraduates, and accessing campus resources. As sophomores, they will collaborate with Southern’s public health department to take on community-based health research, and work with a theater company housed at Southern to create Theater of the Oppressed-style productions. They will be able to take a course on Common Ground’s campus, taught by Southern faculty and bearing college credit. They can also choose to take courses for free at SCSU -- and are more likely to experience success because of the supports that are in place.   What if students’ leadership portfolio and school-wide leadership framework were tools for documenting mastery and growth in non-academic and academic competencies, across all of these experiences and settings? What if our students’ academic advisors worked with students and their families to create and leverage the mix of learning opportunities that were right for them?      When students participate in a program at the Peabody Museum, or an internship in our Nature Year program, they and the staff who supervise them will document their learning goals and outcomes using Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework – earning credit by demonstrating growth and mastery of transferable skills. Working with Common Ground’s art teacher, they will demonstrate how these out-of-school experiences demonstrate mastery of subject area standards, as well – allowing them to earn advanced art credit toward graduation.  Similarly, the grades and feedback that students receive in their Common Ground courses will reflect both students’ growth in transferable leadership skills, and their mastery of academic standards.   Students’ advisors will help students identify and dive into experiences that match their interests, and will coordinate with the staff responsible for overseeing expanded learning to ensure that a clear learning plan is in place. Over four years of high school, students’ work in advisory will have scaffolded deep growth in non-academic domains: supporting social/emotional development, increased agency and leadership capacity, college and career exploration, and the goal-setting and follow-through skills needed to take control of their educational experience. By the time they graduate, students will have built and defended a rich electronic portfolio that integrates academic learning and leadership competencies. It will be the norm to share these portfolios with college admissions offices and prospective employers. Students’ transcripts will also reflect growth and mastery through this rich engagement with the wider learning ecosystem.  What if -- through these experiences and the flexible pathways that connect them -- every Common Ground student graduated ready for college success (recognizing that some students will choose to pursue other paths), powerful environmental justice leadership, meaningful careers, and healthy, happy, whole, sustainable lives? That is our ultimate vision: That students choose their own path AND meet universally high expectations for growth and competence.","50 - 74% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",225,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0.33,0.47,0,0.17,0.03,0.83,0.06,0.66,0.3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","4-yer portfolio graduation requirement","We have experimented with this","CNM Student Success Skills Survey","We use this systematically across our school","In-house surveys focused on SEL, school climate, etc., incorporating questions from externally validated instruments.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXxxl7xDIfWdi7ZN4tNQqamZfNevOKewLq_b2MOnN5k/edit?usp=sharing",NA,NA,"Both helps and hinders","Really helps","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders",NA,"Joel Tolman","Director of Community Impact & Engagement","jtolman@commongroundct.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

We nurture and cultivate self-efficacy, social emotional healing and economic fluency as the primary tools for disrupting generational cycles of poverty, racism, and inequity.

Ethical Use and Equity: AI tools must be employed to support inclusive and equitable education for all students, irrespective of their background or abilities. AI applications should be free from biases and promote fairness and diversity in the learning environment.  Privacy and Data Security: All AI systems will adhere to stringent data protection standards, safeguarding student information in compliance with applicable privacy laws. Consent from parents or guardians will be mandatory for any student data collection by AI technologies.  Transparency and Human Oversight: AI usage in the school will be transparent, with clear communication to students, parents, and staff about how and why AI is used. Decisions influenced by AI will be subject to final review by human personnel to ensure accountability.  Curriculum Integration: AI will be integrated into the curriculum to complement and enhance traditional teaching methods, not replace them. Teachers will receive training to effectively use AI tools in their instruction.  Safety and Continuous Evaluation: We commit to maintaining a safe learning environment, both physically and digitally. The impact of AI on student learning and well-being will be continuously monitored, with adjustments made based on feedback from the school community.","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Students who promote from our program have excelled in high school.

Set personal goals, reflect often, and connect their learning to their life and future self.  -Drive their learning, own their journey, and make it personalized.

Our team approaches high school differently. We invest in every aspect of our students’ lives to prepare them with the tools, support, and connections they need to thrive. We focus on practical projects instead of tests and partner with leaders in New Mexico’s ACE industries to get everyone learning on their feet rather than cramped behind a desk. We all know the world of work is changing, and education should too. That’s why we’re building a better future together.   We are caring.  At ACE, we make sure every student gets one-on-one support. Our school is a safe and caring place   where students discover their unique strengths, grow, and thrive. As a community, we believe in the power of courage, integrity, and purpose. We hold each other accountable and bring out the best in each other so that we can build a better future together.   We are grounded. ACE offers practical experiences and expert connections that prepare our students for success in life and work. We are free, local, and public, and we have been firmly grounded in our community since 2010. At ACE we pair hands-on projects with highly engaged teachers and staff.  We make sure that every student — whether returning to school after an absence, raising a family, or holding down a job — has the individualized support they need to succeed.  We are connected. At ACE, we know that when we work as a team, everyone wins. That’s why we build connections between students, educators, community partners, and industry leaders to bring out the best in all of us. We actively engage with our local neighborhoods to provide resources and support for a healthy community. Every year we connect ACE students to industry leaders for mentorship and real life learning opportunities. New Mexico professionals join us in the classroom and help design our projects. These vital connections support our students and offer opportunities to give back to the place we all call home.","50 - 74% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",270,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0.02,0,0.02,0.9,0,0.06,0,0.94,0.3,1,0.35,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We use this systematically across our school","Search Institute DAP","We use this systematically across our school","Self designed surveys",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really helps","No effect","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","No effect","Really hinders","No effect","Really helps","Somewhat hinders","No effect","No effect",NA,"Justin Trager","Executive Director","Justin@ACELeadership.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Teachers work closely with each student and meet them where they’re at to ensure academic success. One student researched immigration reform and shared the negative impacts that current policies had on their life, and then shared their ideas for more just and humane policies moving forward. Others focused on issues such as gun safety, healthcare, or climate change. Students reflect on their culminating project and their time spent at RISE through a presentation of learning, sharing ways in which they grew, and how the lessons they learned at RISE will lead to success in their post-secondary goals.  RISE provides an empowering education by partnering with service providers, leveraging student voice, and centering the school experience around youth who are most frequently written out of the larger educational narrative. The school intentionally recruits staff members who want to work closely in a small, tight-knit team and to build a strong, nurturing community of resilience from the ground up. Educators receive special training in trauma-informed care, nonviolent crisis intervention, restorative practices, and the workings of the legal and foster-care systems.  RISE doesn’t have rigid course sequences or grade levels. The school promotes a stable and trusting environment that reconnects young people with learning at any time—through year-round extended hours, face-to-face and online learning. RISE partners with social services and operates from three locations, allowing students to access critical services and resources without taking them too far away from their academic experiences. Students get transportation through rideshare programs to make sure they don’t miss school, work, or appointments.","75 - 100% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,"We hold a youth build authorization enabling us to service youth up until the age of 25 with continuous enrollment.",0,0,1,0.54,0.02,0.32,0,0,0.05,0.07,0.95,0.15,0.6,0.32,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,"Yes, Da Vinci Schools has developed a program that uses AI to fuel project based learning.

These are students who may be older than the typical high school student, they might be on probation, they might be young parents and/or they may have full-time jobs, all of which can get in the way of school being their number one priority. Compared with other students across the L.A. school district, RISE students are twice as likely to have diagnosed disabilities, three times as likely to be experiencing homelessness, and 20 times as likely to be in the foster care system.   Since the Fall of 2020 when the CA Department of Education began work on officially approving alternative assessments for schools to demonstrate growth, RISE HS students have been demonstrating significant grade-level and above grade-level skill on the Northwest Education Association Measure of Academic Progress. From Fall 2020 to Fall 2023, almost 300 RISE HS students have taken one or both MAP periodic assessments offered by RISE. This alone is cause for celebration as our students’ lives and schedules, not to mention past trauma due to poorly managed and poorly messaged testing, do not predispose them to guaranteed availability to test. An analysis of seven of these periodic assessment administrations in that 3 year time frame found 242 unduplicated students had valid MAPS reading assessments, and 253 unduplicated students had valid MAPS math assessments. The focus of the analysis was on grade-level norm performance, at or or above grade-level (9, 10, 11, or 12) on one or more of the test administrations, in reading or math. In most of RISE High’s statistically significant subgroups, student performance was commensurate with or better than the performance of RISE HS as a whole.",NA,NA,1,"Committee data analysis and conversations have identified that RISE HS students feel that their school is a place where adults care about them sincerely and authentically, and that most students at RISE believe that they have an adult who is trustworthy and accepting enough to go to in the event that immediate support is needed. The school staff has significant training and experience that equip them to work from a trauma informed lens, which is critical in establishing a place of emotional and physical safety for students who have experienced long-term and repeated trauma. The student experience survey data also shows that a vast majority of students at RISE HS feel safe from acts of physical or social bullying based on race, gender issues, or other differences. Students mention feeling respected by teachers annually, and express a belief in teachers’ ability to prepare them for life after high school. Survey data also reveals that RISE HS students have a strong sense of identity with regard to their academic skill sets; they feel they have agency, they believe they are organized, and prepared, and they feel they are engaged, capable students and learners.

Let’s start with a story.  “How can we reduce the environmental and social impact of our shops?” The managers of Pinwheel Coffee and Framework Cycles asked this to Embark students early in the school year. And, they spent the next two months answering it. Students started with an environmental audit of the shops. They identified issues like plastic and paper use, rubber and metal waste, production of coffee, tea, and milk, and materials that bikes and components are made of, among other things.   In many places, the learning would stop there but at Embark we strive to go deeper. Guided by the educators, students explored their chosen issue. In science, they tackled topics such as properties of matter, chemical change, and erosion. In social studies, they identified countries where key products are grown, mined, or produced. They researched government structures and policies related to their issue to understand the impact.  What really sets Embark apart is that the learning and work has real meaning and impact.  Students used their research to create formal presentations to the shop managers. Once accepted, students got to actually implement their recommendations in the shops. Students wrote the text and designed posters to inform Pinwheel patrons about why almond milk now costs extra. They worked with bike manufacturers to stock new more sustainable brands at Framework. They worked with the local government and nonprofits to create a rubber recycling program for used bike tubes. In short, they made real change happen.","50 - 74% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Man","Latinx",32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.55,0.25,0.45,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Our learners are leading the development of this","No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,NA,NA,"We use this systematically across our school",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"valid measures that actually measure things beyond traditional academics and standard schooling.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Really hinders","No effect","No effect","Somewhat hinders",NA,"Really hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders",NA,NA,NA,"Brian Hyosaka","Head of School","brianh@embarkeducation.org","Miguel Gonzalez","Executive Director","miguel@greatworkinc.org","Latinx","Man",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years","5+ years",NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Students are able to get extra support through the more flexible schedule that we now have. Students have control over their pace of learning with twenty percent of the curriculum. The other eighty percent is project-based learning. Along with the personalization, students can show mastery through the Cognitive Skill rubric that is universal to all grades. The rubric is used for English, Science and Social Studies. The rubric provides students the opportunity to show true grade level understanding, meaning that a student might be in 5th grade but has mastery in certain standards on a 4th-grade level, while other standards are on a 7th-grade level. Cognitive skills are repeated throughout projects to allow students time to show growth in a skill at their own pace and provide students with multiple opportunities to gain mastery. Student learning has been impacted by the cognitive skills rubric which provides continuous learning and improvement cycle.","25 - 49% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",402,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0.04,0.07,0,0.1,0,0.75,0.04,0.25,0.04,0.73,0.24,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hi2MHfTl0CUhSPD6ec5RC8pBIGn_nQO1LpCMkMzmhlQ/edit?usp=sharing",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Both helps and hinders",NA,"Both helps and hinders",NA,"Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders",NA,"Both helps and hinders",NA,"Michele Price","Principal","mprice@lincolncsd.com",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,"Less than a year",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Modern learners have the chance to create and forge meaningful learning experiences and connect with the world around them.  We recognize that the emergence of technology provides boundless access to information and opportunities to create, design, and invent. Technology also connects learners on a local and global level, to foster communication, collaboration, and creativity. Students now, more than ever, are equipped with the tools to innovate, to reimagine their education, and to serve as pioneers in both existing and new fields.   Preparing students for an unpredictable future requires a variety of knowledge, skills, and dispositions.  -As global citizens, students must be able to demonstrate an understanding of others’ needs and understand the value of a diversity of experiences, cultures, and perspectives.  -As solution seekers they need to be able to recognize obstacles, diagnose the issues that limit progress, apply strategies to address their concerns, and reflect on the effectiveness of their response.  -As skillful collaborators, students to work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams in a variety of formats.  -As inspired innovators, they need to be able to elaborate, refine, analyze, evaluate, and iterate their ideas in order to maximize their creative efforts. -As mindful learners, they need to be able to regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they persist toward personal and learning goals.  -As effective communicators, they must articulate and listen with attention to knowledge, values, attitudes, and intentions.    Although we recognize the changing realities of the modern world, there are current aspects of our professional work that remain important for the future of Nipmuc. We must continue to provide students with opportunities to be introduced to key content and knowledge needed to ignite their passions, broaden their understanding, and develop cultural literacy. We also recognize that we need to continue to prepare our students to achieve in traditional forms of assessment that are valued by colleges and employers.  ​Because traditional achievement is only one measure of success, we must expand our definition to include moments of reflection, resilience, creativity, collaboration, experimentation, and inspiration.   As our world evolves, our professional practices must reflect and include opportunities to collaborate, reflect, innovate, and initiate.  Students should be encouraged to seek novel approaches to learning. As educators, we must continually reflect, review, and revise our professional work to make sure our work supports our definition of learning, beliefs about learning, and the vision of our graduates.","0 - 24% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Prefer not to say","Multiple races/ethnicities",556,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0.02,0.01,0.07,0,0.87,0.03,0.13,0.01,0.15,0.16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Nipmuc has developed an Innovation Career Pathway for Computer Science and will be launching a pathway for Business Marketing and Finance in the fall.

Each term, students further develop these competencies while gaining exposure to a variety of themes and issues. At the heart of NuVu’s curriculum are studios, a series of immersive, interdisciplinary, three- to four-week projects. In a typical trimester, a student will participate in two different studios designed by our team of expert coaches. Each trimester ends with an open innovation period during which students have the freedom to dig deeper into a topic of particular interest from earlier in the term.  In studios designed for younger students, our coaches focus on supporting the development of foundational skills and creative confidence. As students learn to navigate open-ended problems, collaborate effectively, build empathy for others and communicate their ideas using a variety of media, studios become more sophisticated. This process eventually prepares each student to complete a 12th grade Capstone Project on a topic of their choosing.

Our strong vision is rooted in our core belief that each unique learner at St. John Paul II has gifts to celebrate and that every child can achieve at high levels.  In partnership with the University of Notre Dame, we use blended learning, which combines targeted, personalized online lessons, small-group learning, and classroom instruction to fill the gaps in each scholar’s knowledge.  At the same time, our teachers employ instructional methods that help every scholar successfully work with rigorous grade-level material.  This ensures that each child, at every academic level, will experience growth with the goal of reaching grade level proficiency.  Our scholars take ownership of their education and collaborate with teachers to create individual learning plans that identify their goals for academic growth and incorporate parent participation.  We continually measure scholar growth, which allows us to determine the specific areas in which a scholar needs more care and attention.  We partner with families to prepare each scholar for high school success, with expectations that they will graduate and seek higher education.

The learning environment allows students to develop in these areas in multiple ways. Students participate in daily circle activities where they can deepen their understanding of themselves and their community. We use restorative practices to repair and minimize harm, allowing for student's to develop a myriad of personal skills. Students co-create curriculum at the beginning of each year with their teachers. This includes, but is not limited to, proposing topics, self-assessing their own work, developing their own projects and courses, and leading learning activities themselves.

In Design Studio, we want to ensure that students graduate prepared for the college of today, as well as the college of tomorrow. If there is one thing our community knows, it is that being flexibly educated, being able to learn not just about things, but HOW to learn, prepares you for whatever a changing world might throw at you. At its very core, that is what Design Studio is all about.  We do this by helping students truly master the subjects they are learning–while at the same time making sure that students are learning how to learn. We are a Mastery-Based program, so when students undertake a topic to learn, whether it be Algebra 2 or Physics or Entrepreneurship, students have academic goals to reach before they move on. You can be assured that when a student finishes a topic in Design Studio, and meets the mastery goals, that student will know that topic, and even more importantly how to use that topic in other settings.  The Design Studio at Mead is a multi-age, multi-disciplinary community that is four or five periods.  Because students spend their core classes with us, we believe that it provides a very cohesive experience into high school from middle school, or transitioning from grade level to grade level. Students have both adult mentors AND peer mentors to help them navigate Mead High School. Students have the opportunity to “go out” from the Studio and take other classes that they might be interested in, or that they are required to take.  In conjunction with the Mead College and Career Counselor, we work individually with students on a college plan and we mentor students individually through the process of applying to college as well as applying for scholarships and financial aid.","0 - 24% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0.02,0,0.03,0.07,0.02,0.76,0.1,0.24,0.03,0.17,0.29,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Support and advocacy from the school district for non-traditional learning options such as ours.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"We use it in ways to promote learning, brainstorming, and workshopping of work.

This disparity in academic performance between younger and older students in BMF MicroSchools suggests the importance of early intervention and support in ensuring academic success. It highlights the need for targeted interventions, personalized learning approaches, and additional support for older students who may be starting at a disadvantage academically.  To address this issue and support the academic growth of older students in BMF MicroSchools, tailored strategies such as individualized learning plans, remedial support, small group instruction, and targeted interventions can be implemented. By providing differentiated support based on the specific needs of each student, it is possible to help older students catch up to their peers and progress towards grade-level proficiency.  Additionally, ongoing assessment, progress monitoring, and collaboration between teachers, parents, and support staff are essential to track the academic growth of older students, identify areas of improvement, and implement effective interventions to support their academic success within the BMF MicroSchools framework.","IXL - BMF Progress and growth 2 19 2024.pdf","F_BxeB8ulnYY1XgBj",0,NA,NA,NA,"Somewhat hinders","Really helps","No effect","Somewhat hinders","No effect","No effect","Somewhat helps","Really hinders","Really hinders",NA,"Really hinders","We especially appreciate the philanthropic dollars and funders who at least fund for 1-2 years, which will help us get our parents adjusted to being on ESAs.","Tiffany Dudley","Executive Personal Assistant to CEO","tiffanydudley@blackmothersforums.com","Janelle Wood","Founder, CEO","info@blackmothersforums.com","Black","Woman",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Valor is a hybrid school, so that means we let an online program with lots of formative data set the floor(foundation) and the teachers who are with the student set the ceiling.  For the students, they will feel empowered to apply learning in the the classrooms and out of school with teachers who have demonstrated a connection to their lives.  Students will develop the self-advocacy and agency to choose how much help or structure they want outside of class time.     To do this we use an instructional model that is color coded with blue and red connected as hexagons resembling a beehive to show interdependence.  The Red is what online does for the students, families, teachers, admin and blue is what the humans bring to the experience.  This is an essential step because a good hybrid plan must have that well described and delineated so our amazing teachers aren’t do what a course management system with good formative assessments can do.","50 - 74% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",232,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,1,1,0.04,0.01,0.14,0.48,0,0.25,0.08,0.75,0.12,0.17,0.22,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,"We seek to build a model for education that empowers all aspects of a school community while maximizing the online/digital tools so that the human part of the equation has significant impact.

We achieve this approach in four powerful ways:  1. Joyfully Rigorous Learning. I Dream PCS learners learn how to learn. They engage in learning that makes them think deeply and delve into challenging text and math problems like detectives. They experiment, write, problem-solve, and research independently and with their peers and adults (called “coaches” instead of “teachers”) to learn Common Core State Standards and to answer their questions about themselves and the world around them. It’s the challenges that make them grow and learn who they are.  2. Dream Time. I Dream PCS learners have weekly Dream Time to identify and explore a curiosity or interest they want to learn about. Curiosity breeds deep learning and innovation. Coaches working with learners conference with and observe them in Dream Time to document the skills learners use in their deep learning and to guide them to transfer the skills and knowledge to their academic learning, or apply the Common Core State Standards they learn in academic classes in Dream Time.   3. Social-Emotional Learning. Research shows that learners who engage in social-emotional learning demonstrate better academic performance, positive attitudes and reduced stress. I Dream PCS learners meet daily in Community Time with their coaches and classmates to develop their emotional intelligence and healthy relationships with themselves and others.  4. Customized learning. A Customized Learning Plan (CLP) is a living document created with each learner, their family and coaches to identify learning targets and action steps towards mastery of math, literacy, social-emotional learning, and dreamer goals. CLPs are a learner-centered assessment practice to build ownership of learning through continuous goal-setting, reflection and mastery of standards. I Dream PCS learners understand what they have learned and communicate why they learned it, and demonstrate progress and achievement of CLP goals.","75 - 100% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Woman","Black",84,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0.94,0.02,0,0.02,0.02,0.98,0,NA,0.21,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,"Yes, extremely",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","Kelvin Education surveys",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really helps","Really helps","Both helps and hinders",NA,NA,"Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","Really helps","Really helps",NA,"Really helps",NA,"Janine Gomez","Executive Director","jgomez@idreampcs.org",NA,NA,NA,"Black","Woman",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years","3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We utilize inclusionary principles and practices to bring this vision to life including: * Inclusive Mission and Vision * Universal Design for Learning  * Flexible Service Delivery * Core Master Schedule * Collaborative Planning * Co-Teaching.  Our work to ensure learning, leading and belonging for each member of our community is grounded in a belief in the competence and potential of each student as a member of the general education classroom when given supportive, relevant and universally design learning experiences. Students experience the full range of learning supports and extensions as members of their classroom community and as a school community, we actively work to disrupt injustice in all forms. Our students experience community learning with learner variability is the constant and the development of understanding of self, learner attributes and the tools for learning best is just a part of each and every school day. As our students experience learning in community they are encouraged to welcome differences, to explore how they learn best and are given the necessary support to thrive.  The Ruby Bridges Elementary community and culture is often described a “special” in its positivity, warmth and the genuine feeling of possibility brimming from each classroom. Our school is a family of diverse members, each coming with unique backgrounds and experiences, and our goal each day is to amplify the strengths of our community and affirm our students along their pathway in elementary school.

Our students grow into their full selves as problem solvers, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners through project based learning, inquiry,  research, and debate of global issues, public and private internships and service, and civic engagement all while building solidarity in our school community and beyond.  At A School Without Walls, we believe that students’ voice and agency is key to their learning process and success.  As a team, we will keep this core belief at the center of our work.   To ensure that all children reach their academic and future personal goals, we will hold ourselves to high standards of student outcomes and student care by looking at data points along the way during the year to assess how our students are doing.    Curricularly, we are flipping the model of “what is core” and “what is elective.” Passion projects, which center the interests and experiences of our young people are primary and core and our students’ core content credits are baked into passion projects and stand-alone math and science classes.  Our Competency Based, narrative progress reports and mastery transcript student profiles enable us to implement a system for performance assessment that responds to student learner needs.  Through our project based, real world curriculum and programmatic structure, we are ensuring that our students are equipped to display academic and SEL competency, through community-based, place-based classrooms.    As we grow and develop in the coming years, we see our students as leaders in our school and local communities, functioning as agents of change with the knowledge and skills they have developed in the classroom and through their relationships with NYC business and non-profit industries.  We believe: if given the opportunity to study something in depth that they truly care about, young people will empower themselves to explore their passions, transform communities, and create a more beautiful world.","75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Woman","Latinx",142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0.11,0.32,0.22,0,0.17,0.18,0.83,0.01,0.65,0.35,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","NYCOB Belonging Survey","We use this systematically across our school","NYCDOE Learning Environment Surveys",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really helps","Really helps","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Really helps","Somewhat helps","Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat helps",NA,"Veronica Coleman","Principal","Vcoleman3@schools.nyc.gov",NA,NA,NA,"Latinx","Woman",1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,"1-2 years",NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vision: Happy Kids, Engaged in Healthy Relationships, on a Path to Gainful Employment.   Our Approach:   Signature design elements at all grade levels will serve as a catalyst for creating interest-based, authentic learning opportunities unique to each student. Design elements include:  Advisory  Often described as a “second family” by students, an advisory is a core organizational and relational structure that nurtures belonging. Learners stay with an advisor and a group of fellow classmates for multiple years, building close personal relationships that last a lifetime. Advisory experiences intentionally cultivate a learner-centered mindset by inspiring learners to develop the agency, skills, dispositions, and abilities needed to take charge of their learning journey. Advisors stand alongside students as they explore their passions and interests and help students turn challenges into learning opportunities.  Competency-based  Each student is a unique individual with knowledge, skills, and dispositions developed through learning experiences inside and outside school. Our competency-based system creates equitable learning structures and conditions that empower each student to meet rigorous, common expectations for learning through timely, differentiated support. Central to our approach is an intense focus on student growth through meaningful feedback and permission for them to show how they are progressing in many ways.  World of Work A national leader in early childhood career development, the Cajon Valley World of Work initiative engages students in hands-on experience right in their classrooms with a wide variety of careers, preparing them for their futures. World of Work uses each student’s interests, values, and strengths to tailor exploration, simulations, and virtual field trips with career professionals. Beginning in the Freshman year, all high school and post-secondary students will leverage early childhood interest exploration to identify and serve off-campus internships with highly qualified mentors. Local partners such as San Diego Workforce Partnership and Biocom are already playing a role in defining World of Work opportunities and engaging with our students.  Difference Making On-campus studio exploration empowers student entrepreneurs, makers, and inventors to impact their communities and world through their work and ideas. Students engage in community-based projects that tap their interests and strengths to make a meaningful difference in others’ lives. Their impact is amplified by our school’s multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural approach to learning. An example may include designing, building, and installing an equine sensory trail for children with autism.  Family Connection Accomplishing our vision challenges us to think differently about how we work together with students, families, and our community. Truly personalizing education beyond mere academic work involves looking at each student holistically. Families know their children best and they must play a proactive role in their children’s learning, collaborating in the planning and assessment of their student’s work.  Reimagining Postsecondary  Our goal is to push beyond dual and concurrent enrollment in community college to a coherent TK-14 experience, moving toward a strengths-based, truly personalized postsecondary experience that results in gainful employment opportunities in our immediate community. It is not our intent to partner with a community college to mirror or offer their program. Rather, create an integrated approach that builds on our World of Work initiative by extending internship and coursework beyond high school. Post high school students will maintain a relationship with an industry mentor and receive “wrap-around” services. Their Bostonia advisor, social worker, career counselor, and support staff will ensure an Associates’ degree and/or certificate of completion.","50 - 74% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",1200,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0.01,0.08,0.75,0,0.12,0.04,0.88,0.57,0.77,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Neutral",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Shift of focus and priorities at teacher credentialing programs- the educational pipeline needs to shift to meet the needs of our current and future workforce.","We would love to demonstrate our use of AI to create individualized pathways for every individual.","No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We use this systematically across our school","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We use this systematically across our school","Growth Transcript","We use this systematically across our school","Journey of a Graduate",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat hinders","Really hinders","Somewhat hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","Really hinders","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders",NA,"Nerel Winter","CEO","wintern@cajonvalley.net",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Our mission is to support our diverse scholars to live full lives and to succeed in college, career, and life.  Scholars will find their purpose and passion so that they can cultivate the critical hope, optimism and leadership essential to be catalysts in their community and world.  ​ Because of this, we intentionally create school environments that prepare our scholars to be leaders and change-makers.  Far too many schools prioritize compliance over engagement and rote memorization over critical thinking and collaboration.  At Catalyst, we are reimagining school to ensure our scholars are prepared for the future.   At Catalyst: Bremerton scholars develop the agency to lead their own learning alongside their peers.  We leverage a co-teaching model to offer small group and student lead instruction in grades from Kindergarten through 8th grade.  Hallmarks of the student experience at Catalyst: Bremerton include a daily class called Sunrise.  During Sunrise scholars explore the school's BRAVE values (Belonging, Resilience, Achievement, Vulnerability, and Enthusiasm) and participate in social emotional learning including mindfulness.  Another important element of our student experience is a course called Change Maker Space (CMS).  During CMS scholars participate in project based learning units that are aligned with our humanities courses of study and allow scholars to explore community challenges and work together to generate solutions.","0 - 24% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",504,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0.01,0.05,0.13,0.12,0.01,0.55,0.13,0.45,0.01,0.56,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We have experimented with this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We have experimented with this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amanda Gardner","co-founder","amandasuegardner@gmail.com",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At Compass Rose Harvest, our students engage hands-on with plants and animals through exploratory and project-based learning. Through these nature-based experiences, our students develop a deep understanding of their role in contributing to a healthy self, community, and planet.  Each semester, students in grades K-12 work on an agricultural science project during their regular AgSci class and independently. Teachers decide how to build in project work time throughout other core subjects to reinforce connections between agricultural sciences and more traditional school work. At the culmination of each project, there is a presentation component that is designed by the student with teacher guidance. For example, Harvest students can choose to present in a gallery, present to their peers during weekly assembly, distribute through the Harvest family newsletter, post on the school’s Facebook page, or present at an evening or Saturday event.","25 - 49% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",466,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0.01,0.01,0.07,0.42,0,0.45,0.04,0.55,0.08,0.5,0.15,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"We use this systematically across our school",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really hinders","Somewhat helps","Somewhat hinders","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect",NA,"Somewhat helps",NA,"Paul Morrissey","Founder & CEO","paul.morrissey@compassroseschools.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years","1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

School letter grades measure how the state’s K-12 schools are serving students and helping them to succeed academically. This is the first year school letter grades have been awarded in the State of Tennessee following legislation that passed in 2016 establishing a state-wide school level grading system.   The University Schools letter grades reflect the highest grades an individual school can receive and reflect the highest level of success across the following measured indicators: overall success rate for achievement, overall growth, growth for the lowest performing 25% of students in each school and college and career readiness.   “We are proud of our schools and the work they do to help students to grow and achieve within our classrooms and within our community” said Dr. Sally G. Parish, associate vice president for Educational Initiatives at the University of Memphis. “We have a truly diverse school community, with students joining us from every local zip code. These letter grades reinforce that every student can succeed within our University Schools, and we are proud of the work of our teachers and school leaders who make a difference in the lives of our children every day.”   In addition to the recent “A” report card designation, University Schools have also been recognized as Reward Schools, Innovative School Models, STEM and STEAM Designated Schools, Blue Ribbon Schools and Trauma Informed Schools for the State of Tennessee. Their 2022-23 school data reflected the highest success rate of any public school system in the state.   “Today’s letter grade announcement recognizes the tremendous achievement of our University Schools, which serve as a training and laboratory school compendium for the entire State of Tennessee,” said Dr. David Russomanno, executive vice president for Academic Affairs and provost at the University of Memphis. “Our University Schools are a long-standing and unique part of our University community, and they serve a critical role in preparing the next generation of teachers, leaders and learners across Memphis. We are fortunate to have them as part of our University culture and community and look forward to supporting their continued growth and success.”",NA,NA,1,"100% of 10th grade students participating in community service, monthly.",NA,NA,"Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat helps","Somewhat hinders","No effect","Somewhat helps",NA,"Both helps and hinders","Somewhat hinders",NA,"Dr. Kristle Hodges Johnson","Executive Director","k.hodges.johnson@k12.memphis.edu",NA,NA,NA,"Black","Woman",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Less than a year",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years","Less than a year",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The idea is to establish an environment where the whole child-- all parts of their identity-- are considered with intentional empathy and rigor to help them grow academically and as leaders.   Additionally, we support college and career readiness through the intentional development of a pathway to concurrent enrollment courses early in the High School Experience. There are career and mentorship opportunities through our Enrichment programming twice a week during the school day; we partner with local organizations to curate experiences for scholars to receive instruction in areas of interest like audio production, cybersecurity certification, coding and programming, and cultural exploration. Competency as measured by the ACCUplacer exam is a graduation requirement for our school district. We administer the assessment within the first 6 weeks of our scholars' High School experience as 9th graders. This serves as a benchmark for where they are in terms of accomplishing a graduation requirement and allows us to begin planning for the Spring semester course selections. Scholars who demonstrate competency become eligible for enrollment in courses that bear High School and College credit (Concurrent Enrollment). The ultimate goal is to ensure as many scholars as are eligible are able to take at least one Concurrent Enrollment Course and 35% of each graduating class will leave High School with an Associates Degree.","75 - 100% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Man","Black",167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0.9,0.03,0,0,0.07,1,0.02,0.83,0.1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"No, not very",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Lack of Leadership",NA,"No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,"Robert F.

Instead, EVA is more representative of what students will encounter in college or the workplace. There are some meetings that are mandatory — spaces that require real-time collaboration. But outside of that, students have flexibility to tackle their work in ways that fit their lives and to access the people and supports they uniquely need. - Asynchronous Learning: We leverage online courses to cover the primary coursework required for a CA diploma. Within these courses, students are working towards clear milestones and rigorous end of unit assignments, but have flexibility for when and how they pace the content. - Advisory: Every morning, students start the day together in an advisory video call. This space is designed for students to connect, center themselves for the day, and to nurture the life and wellness skills that are essential for success but often undervalued in school. The time is spent in a mix of whole school gatherings and with a consistent small group of students who serve as the """"home base"""" for the year. - Weekly Student Schedules: Weekly, students submit weekly plans that are authentic to the lives and responsibilities of each student. - Study Hall: After advisory, students have the option to attend study hall in order to connect with subject-matter educators to get targeted support in their coursework. They can bring questions that are coming up in their digital coursework, get feedback, or sign up to go deeper in a specific area. - Weekly Coaching: Students are paired with an educator who serves as their coach for the year. At a minimum, they meet 1:1 weekly to for a dedicated session focused on building the habits of success that enables students to thrive in this model in beyond. Coaches are there to help students set goals, monitor progress, and advocate for the supports they need. Coaches will also be able to support students through targeted interventions when needed.  - PMC Journeys: Across the year, students will propose and complete projects that enable them to explore passions and possible career paths. This might look like completing independent study on the future of AI or interning with a local non-profit to learn about child development.  In-person Meet Ups: Once a quarter, students come together for an excursion. In addition to creating the opportunity to build community in-person, they are set up to expose students to future possibilities -- college campuses or exciting workplaces. Meet Ups are optional for students to attend.","75 - 100% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0.02,0.05,0.84,0,0.02,0.07,0.98,0.11,0.83,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,"Neutral",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,"Yes",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Both helps and hinders","Somewhat helps","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat helps","Somewhat helps","Both helps and hinders","No effect","Somewhat helps",NA,"Drew Dozier","Virtual Program Director","ddozier@ednovate.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our students develop 21st century skills, a global perspective, and empathetic action in an environment that nurtures creativity and encourages curiosity.  We empower students of all abilities to find strength in their community, believe in the power of their ideas, and influence action in the world around them.  Our small, mixed age classes create a loving environment where each student builds a strong relationship with the peers and educator resulting in a deeper and richer educational experience.  We meet students at their level and create the right amount of challenge for them to achieve their goals while loving learning. Content is not age or grade specific, it is student specific.  We believe that a good educational model isn’t everyone getting the same thing, it's everyone getting what they need to be successful and thrive.   Deep, interdisciplinary project based learning contributes to the magic of Up Academy.  Students engage in meaningful projects that allow them to engage authentically in their community to solve problems.   Over the course of a trimester the students are able to grow in wonder as they make discoveries and explore their topic through hands-on activities and field trips.   Each project culminates with an exhibition day, where the students get to demonstrate their learning and craftsmanship.   Our students focus on developing their own identities as individuals and an understanding of who they are as Americans in a global world, humans in a diverse ecosystem, and critical questioners in an ever changing environment.

That's why we replace lectures with engaging projects and dictatorial """"""""behavior managers"""""""" with 1-1 executive functioning coaches who help students learn how to manage their own schedule and work habits. Kairos students practice navigating real-world choices (such as when, where, how, and with whom to work) within a safe, supportive school environment. Kairos develops students not just into freethinkers, ready to thrive in a modern economy, but self-governing citizens, ready to lead both themselves and their communities.  Personalized Learning  Some students excel at English; others struggle with math. Our multimedia coursework adapts to meet kids where they are. It's like giving every student a textbook tailored to their exact questions and learning style. Paired with one-on-one tutoring, the differentiated instruction challenges everyone but leaves no one behind.  Mentoring & Choice  Students meet with their mentor every week to develop the mindsets, skills, and habits of productivity. Working with families, mentors gradually transition students to college-style self-directed learning. Students guide this transition, earning more scheduling choice as they make responsible study decisions.  Project-Based Learning  To prepare students for 21st-century careers, Kairos coursework trades mindless memorization for creative, hands-on projects. The world is our classroom, and students learn about it firsthand through experiential field trips and internships.  Civic Leadership  Kairos students do more than just talk about leadership. They practice it by leading study groups, extracurricular clubs, and student government. From mediating peer discipline to advising our school board, students own more than just their schedules and education—they own their community.","75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Man","Multiple races/ethnicities",500,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0.05,0.51,0.02,0,0.28,0.14,0.72,0.02,0.68,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,"mostly for administrative tasks","No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","Possip Surveys",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really hinders","Somewhat helps","Somewhat hinders","Really hinders","No effect","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Both helps and hinders","Really hinders",NA,"Really hinders",NA,"Jack Krewson","Chief Strategy Officer + CoFounder","jack.krewson@kairosacademies.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Man",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the past, Joy’s lens on student outcomes was traditional– it measured all young people by the same standard and relied on state test scores as the main success indicator. These are hallmarks of the industrial model: the mainstream model for education seen in a large majority of schools across the country, which prioritizes obedience and conformity. This model is drastically misaligned to the skills and qualities needed for modern-day careers, and widespread data reveals that the industrial model is reinforcing and compounding the socioeconomic and racial inequities it was founded on. Our Board and leadership chose not to move forward with Joy’s previous model, due to our belief that the industrial model, in any form, is incapable of producing equity. Given how fundamentally incompatible the industrial model is with our vision, we have opted to build an entirely new model from the ground up that centers equity, liberation, and an expanded definition of success.  Our redesign team’s first mission was to develop a Portrait of a Learner: an agreed upon set of school-level aspirations for what every young person will know and be able to do by the time they leave Joy. It defines the aims that young people will work towards: Agile, Critically Conscious, Creative, and Collaborative. Developing the Portrait provided an anchor to frame conversations with the Joy community about our collective aspirations for the young people we work with, and to challenge the beliefs that have been held implicitly in Joy’s past ways of operating. Each of our aims is designed with real-world authenticity in mind, so they’re deliberately interdisciplinary, and intentionally combine traditionally academic and non-academic skills. We’ve begun developing sets of indicators that identify the sub-skills within each aim and quantify levels of achievement. In the future, we plan to create robust toolkits for each aim that contain a holistic picture of what it looks like to support young people in developing the aim. In addition to indicators, these toolkits will have guidance for adults as to how to set the conditions for young people to develop and practice the aims. They will also explain the connection between the design decisions in Joy’s new model and the aims themselves, illustrating why we have chosen to allocate time in the way that we have, and how our various practices are aligned to the Portrait.  It’s clear that given the scope and content of our Portrait, our model overall will need to look at learning very differently. We believe the best way to grant young people “at-bats” with the aims is to structure learning in an inquiry-based format, where projects are based in real-world design challenges. We believe that this approach to learning positions skills in their authentic context, and puts young people in the driver's seat: two conditions that we view as essential for achieving the aims in our Portrait. We’re particularly interested in exploring inquiry-based learning with a design thinking lens, because we see a lot of philosophical alignment with our beliefs about the purpose of education. Given that we believe education has both a personal and a larger civic purpose, we’re interested in incorporating design thinking as a process that helps young people grow their sense of agency and explore their place as citizens in a democratic society.  We are also interested in mixed-age groupings because we believe strongly in personalizing learning for each young person while also nurturing relationships across ages and levels of experience. We’d like to design a learning experience driven by individualized goals and pathways, and move outside of the efficiency-based tradition for same-age groupings. Similarly, we’re inspired by school models that prioritize wide exploration of the arts and other activities typically viewed as extracurricular, and intrigued by the benefits that this could provide for individual growth and identity-development. We’d like to implement a cohort model with mixed ages, with a focus on developing a strong sense of community. We’re interested in integrating our cohort model fully into the “regular” learning structure, so that young people are positioned to access learning opportunities from a place of psychological safety.  As we do this work, we intend to stand up an incubator for education innovation here in Durham, where educators across the state and beyond come to learn about what could be possible. We believe that there’s a unique opportunity at Joy, given the high level of support from the Board and leadership, and given the existing talent. In our experience, these conditions are rare and special.","75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",645,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0.02,0.28,0.63,0,0.05,0.02,0.95,0.28,0.85,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Somewhat hinders","Somewhat helps","No effect","No effect","No effect","Really hinders","Really hinders","Both helps and hinders","Somewhat hinders","No effect","No effect",NA,"Donnell Cannon","Executive Director","dcannon@joycharter.org","Sayre Man","Lead Designer","sman@joycharter.org","Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years","5+ years",NA,"Less than a year",NA,NA,"Less than a year",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Campus School is a laboratory school which promotes excellence in teaching and enthusiasm for learning. Through integration of research into an innovative curriculum, the school offers its best to aspiring teachers and to the urban community it serves. A diverse school population allows for valuable relationships and collaborations -- educational, cultural, social, and personal -- among the stakeholders who are involved. Teachers, students, and parents working together can maximize outcomes to the benefit of all involved.   The vision and mission are deeply rooted in the school's CREED which focuses on Collaboration, Research, Excellence in Teaching, Enthusiasm for Learning, and Diversity.  For students to function productively in society, education should provide opportunities for them to be curious and creative; to exercise initiative; to handle responsibilities; to test ideas; to establish opinions about controversial matters; and to develop aesthetic values. Campus School incorporates these opportunities into the school experience each day.  Students will meet high academic expectations because their learning is enhanced by best practices offered by dedicated and capable teachers. The teaching and learning atmosphere of the school prepares students for their eventual place in the larger world. Campus School has been a resource to the Memphis community for over 100 years.  Campus School is in a unique position of serving a diverse population that allows for the building and collaboration of students and teachers from diverse educational, cultural, social, and personal backgrounds.

We partner with out-of-school organizations to develop capacity and resources to imagine greater educational possibilities and programming that is learner-centered, empowers youth voice, and fosters choice and agency.

As an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School, our students are inspired to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and global citizens. We have a profound understanding that humans are natural inquirers, they want to learn and explore in an environment that is safe and engaging. We are developing growth mindsets in our students where they embrace the struggle and understand that the struggle is part of the journey. Teaching is student centered and curriculum is focused on imparting knowledge as well as teaching students to be caring, principled, reflective, balanced, open minded, inquirers, risk takers and thinkers.   Key Elements:   ● Children deserve to be taught at their instructional levels to achieve an education that is rigorous and engaging. When students are taught at instructional levels, they can reach their highest potential of learning as well as being leaders and strong mentors. In every Alturas classroom, instruction is provided in small groups, at instructional. We believe that categorizing students by grade levels limits their ability to reach their academic potential. Students constantly collaborate and communicate with partners and group members. They are taught the importance of taking ownership of their own education and supporting their classmates. Through small group learning the students foster analytical and critical thinking skills and explore real life world problems where every member of the group contributes. They collaborate, question, and discover the world around them.   ● The multi-age classroom is a unique style of teaching that provides student support through peer mentoring and peer collaboration. Another positive aspect to multi-aged classrooms is that students will remain with the same teacher for up to three years. This allows teachers to learn students’ strengths and needs quickly, and to meet students’ needs across an extended period. Our model is based on best practices in education.   ● In classrooms, the teacher primarily acts as a facilitator/trainer to help students become independent, collaborative learners. Our educators teach with our students not at them. They never sit down throughout the day as they are constantly engaged with their students. They go from one instructional group to another giving lessons as students independently take responsibility and guide their learning. Emphasis is placed on the classroom as a collaborative, safe, and supportive community.   ● Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through challenging work, good strategies, and input from others have a growth mindset. Having a growth mindset is essential in this model and understanding that making mistakes, respecting, and analyzing others’ opinion is part of the learning process. Teaching excellence is gained through engagement and collaboration and developing the 21st Century skills of communication, collaboration, critical and creative thinking.

We educate students for awareness and understanding and galvanize girls for global impact. We develop our students’ initiative, independence and habits of mind to prepare them for their individual life paths. We prepare our graduates to shape a changing world.   Miss Porter’s School prepares students for the future to come, not the world that was. This commitment allows us to re-envision the way our faculty teach, the way our students demonstrate their learning, and the way we access, record and represent their educational outcomes. We practice competency-based mastery learning – the transfer of knowledge and skills to a real-world context.  With more than 100 course offerings in arts, humanities, languages, math, sciences and social sciences, students experience a wealth of opportunity during their academic journeys. With an average class size of 12, their intellectual curiosity is encouraged and empowered.  Miss Porter’s School practices competency-based mastery learning which shifts student focus from grades to growth. Competency-based feedback is given for all courses. Rather than exams, we have Demonstrations of Learning — student-shared learning through projects, presentations, performances, and more. The value of competency-based assessment lies in: Greater transparency. More specific and useful information about student progress. Development of intrinsic motivation and a growth mindset. Enhanced consistency, fairness and equity.","0 - 24% people of color","0 - 24% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",330,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0.1,0.3,0.05,0,0.45,0.1,0.55,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,"A desire to create a meaningful learning experience for students and to give students the chance to lead their own learning.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"No, not very",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","Mastery Learning Record",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Somewhat helps","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders","Somewhat hinders",NA,"No effect",NA,"No effect","No effect",NA,NA,"Nelle Andrews","Dean of Curriculum & Instruction","nandrews@missporters.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1-2 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3-4 years",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

At CREATE, we believe in rigorous exploration through the arts and the desegregation of educational subjects.

These two elements embody a transformative approach to education, centering around enhancing the student experience through a blend of cultural relevance, experiential learning, and creative exploration. The learning is meticulously designed to cater to diverse learning needs, fostering a holistic development of students by integrating various learning modalities and Indigenous pedagogies. Here’s a summary highlighting the multifaceted experiences offered:  Cultural Engagement and Literacy: Students in grades 7-8 participate in a critical examination of library books to identify representations of Native cultures, encouraging discussions on authorship and cultural authenticity. This activity not only deepens their understanding of their heritage but also builds critical literacy skills.  Historical Contextualization and Empathy: For 5-6th graders, a Book Club focusing on American Girl stories was selected by the students. This opportunity for deep analysis offers a gateway to exploring historical contexts, further enriched by activities like planting """"Victory Gardens"""" and learning knitting, linking past and present.  Artistic Expression and Digital Literacy: A Mixed Media course offers hands-on experience with digital tools like Photoshop and Canva, alongside traditional artistic mediums, fostering artistic competency and digital literacy among students.  Experiential Learning: Projects like creating winter counts, designing personal medallions, and making ribbon skirts/shirts not only honor cultural traditions but also incorporate practical skills like sewing, embodying experiential learning.  Sustainability and STEAM: Activities like building fish traps and identifying rocks introduce students to sustainability concepts within a STEAM framework, emphasizing environmental stewardship and practical knowledge application.  Well-being and Restorative Practices: The program's emphasis on student and staff well-being, through calm rooms and a values-based approach to discipline, reflects a commitment to nurturing a supportive and respectful learning environment.  Innovative Scheduling and Pedagogy: Takuku challenges traditional educational models by offering diverse course options and employing Indigenous learning principles, aiming to expand students' cognitive abilities and metacognitive awareness.  While still in its infancy and a continued work in progress, this work represents a drastic shift in our educational approach, aiming to reshape our learning environment to better meet the holistic needs of students. By valuing well-being, cultural identity, and hands-on learning experiences, it seeks to prepare students not just academically but also as thoughtful, engaged members of their communities.","75 - 100% people of color","50 - 74% people of color","Woman","American Indian & Alaska Native",100,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0.97,0.03,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.03,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,NA,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,NA,"Administration is supportive of staff utilizing AI to streamline their planning and other work.

The school opened in August, 2011 and serves approximately 175 students in grades K-8. The school is served by 25 staff members and an administrative staff of four. The Middle School Program (this application is for the middle school) has approximately 60 students and many have enrolled because they have struggled in larger schools. Heritage Academy offers a more personalized environment with a high level of support for at-risk students. Students achieve more success and report feeling welcome, cared about and able to perform better because they are treated as individuals and they know the adults in the building care about them. The culture at Heritage is one of the achievements for which the school is recognized and is one of the things staff members are most proud of at the school. The other area of strength for which Heritage stakeholders are proud is our academic growth. Teachers at Heritage help students set aggressive goals for growth in academic areas.  In several recent years, Heritage has been among the top 25 Idaho schools for growth in reading achievement.  Heritage Academy students also participate in enrichment clusters and elective classes that include students from all grade levels and require students to develop authentic (“real world”) products and services.  Past clusters have focused on topics such as woodworking, music, art, recycling/upcycling, wilderness, jewelry, robotics, etc.  Students work together in these cluster and solve community problems or develop products and services that benefit the local or larger community.   Heritage Academy is a school where students, families and staff members feel valued and able to work toward goals that help both individuals and our community thrive.","0 - 24% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",175,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0.02,0,0,0.48,0,0.5,0,0.5,0.26,0.94,0.21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Yes, extremely",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Our goal is to continue to expand community resources.

To give scholars post-graduate options, the school will place each scholar on a sound academic and vocational track.","75 - 100% people of color","75 - 100% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",210,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,1,1,0,0,0.9,0.1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"No, not very",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,"No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have heard of this but we do not use it",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Valiant Cross Academy has a 100% graduation rate and a 100% acceptance into college, military, or professional workforce.",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"No effect","Really helps","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect","No effect",NA,"Anthony Brock","Head of School","anthony@valiantcross.org","Kimberly Baker","Director","kimberly@valiantcross.org","Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years","5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Our learning environment is designed to be a vibrant place where each child's individuality is celebrated and nurtured.  First and foremost, students are encouraged to recognize and embrace their uniqueness. Rather than conforming to a standardized mold, they are empowered to express their creativity freely. Whether through artistic endeavors, scientific exploration, or innovative problem-solving, every child is encouraged to think outside the box and explore their own ideas.  Within this environment, there is a strong emphasis on fostering a sense of care and support among students and educators alike. Collaboration and empathy are core values woven into daily interactions. Students learn from each other, building a community where everyone feels valued and respected.  The Innovation School prioritizes the holistic development of each child. This means nurturing their social, emotional, physical, and intellectual well-being in equal measure. Through a combination of hands-on learning experiences, interactive discussions, and reflective practices, students develop into well-rounded individuals who are equipped to navigate life's challenges with resilience and grace.  Central to our educational philosophy is the belief that every child has unique strengths and passions waiting to be discovered. Teachers act as guides, helping students uncover their interests and talents, and providing opportunities for them to explore and develop these passions further.   Ultimately, the student experience at The Innovation School is one of empowerment and self-discovery. It's a place where children not only learn academic concepts but also learn about themselves – their abilities, their interests, and their potential to make meaningful contributions to the world around them. As they journey through their educational experience, students are supported, challenged, and inspired to become the best versions of themselves.","0 - 24% people of color","0 - 24% people of color",NA,NA,30,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"No, not at all",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,"Yes!

ACE provides a rigorous college-preparation pathway in which students are placed in multi-age, honors-levelled classes based on their skill levels and graduate with a Brookline High School diploma when they complete their content and skill competencies. Because the students are in small classes, they benefit from personalized instruction and a tight-knit community of staff and students. Students in ACE are expected to frequently reflect on their personal growth in developing habits of success and actively engage in the ACE community through their participation in their advisory and in community building activities. ACE students take all of their core academic subjects including English, Math, History and Science in the program while still taking their electives, world language, and health and fitness classes in mainstream. They take two six-week academic classes at a time, averaging three courses in each content area in a given school year. When it is time to assess the student, ACE teachers offer a choice of performance-based assessments that, as much as possible, allow students real-world application of the skills. If a student does not meet a minimum level of competency, “basic competency,” in a class, they do not fail. Instead, they repeat it when it is offered next or take an on-line version of the course, if available. A limited number of ACE online classes are also available for students who want to move at a quicker pace. Even though many ACE students would otherwise take an AP class, they choose not to because they are seeking a more innovative and experiential classroom experience. If an ACE student is seeking a college class experience, ACE places students in actual college classes through dual-enrollment programs at Roxbury Community College and Ben Franklin Institute of Technology where they can earn college credit. In ACE, students also have the option of pursuing internships during school hours for academic credit. This gives students the chance to work with a mentor at a workplace of interest where they do a comprehensive project that is needed by that internship site. In addition to their academic experiences, ACE students participate in community building trips and community service projects which allow students to build a supportive, trusting environment. ACE also works closely with families to be an active partner in their child’s success. Parents or guardians are expected to come in three times a year to participate in a student-run exhibition on their child’s academic progress.","0 - 24% people of color","25 - 49% people of color","Woman","Multiple races/ethnicities",55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0.01,0.09,0.3,0.13,0,0.36,0.11,0.64,0.01,0.46,0.48,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,1,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Yes, somewhat",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,"No, but we are in the process of developing one",NA,"I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","We have experimented with this","I have never heard of this","We use this systematically across our school","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this","I have never heard of this",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"Really helps","Really helps","Both helps and hinders","Both helps and hinders","No effect","Somewhat hinders","No effect","Somewhat helps","No effect","Both helps and hinders","No effect",NA,"Amy Bayer","ACE Program Coordinator","Amy_Bayer@psbma.org",NA,NA,NA,"Multiple races/ethnicities","Woman",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5+ years",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
