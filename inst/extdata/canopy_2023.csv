The goal was to offer a safe, supportive learning environment where students excel through active engagement in meaningful learning experiences. The school also set out to build strong relationships between students, families, and the school, with the goal of creating a community the neighborhood, was proud to call its own. In the early years of Perea, there was significant pushback from families around the approach the school took to social-emotional learning. Families would report not wanting their students to spend time identifying their emotions, for example. In five years, and particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, the community’s views on SEL have shifted. Now families routinely reach out for additional resources around strategies used in school. In addition, mental health has become less of a taboo topic and families have increased their willingness to have their students evaluated for special services if needed.",1,Trauma-informed Classroom Teacher and staff level of Competence Average Score: 86% (Q1) 96.1 (Q2)   Mental Health Support for Students Convenience of students getting pulled out for mental health support  Average Score: 84% (Q1) 96.2 (Q2),1,Child Therapy Impact (1).pdf,F_3Hpg7UhXMmg1JUe,200932,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Deadre Ussery,Executive Director,usseryd@schoolsofperea.org

That's why we replace lectures with engaging projects and dictatorial """"behavior managers"""" with 1-1 executive functioning coaches who help students learn how to manage their own schedule and work habits. Kairos students practice navigating real-world choices (such as when, where, how, and with whom to work) within a safe, supportive school environment. Kairos develops students not just into freethinkers, ready to thrive in a modern economy, but self-governing citizens, ready to lead both themselves and their communities.  Personalized Learning  Some students excel at English; others struggle with math. Our multimedia coursework adapts to meet kids where they are. It's like giving every student a textbook tailored to their exact questions and learning style. Paired with one-on-one tutoring, the differentiated instruction challenges everyone but leaves no one behind.  Mentoring & Choice  Students meet with their mentor every week to develop the mindsets, skills, and habits of productivity. Working with families, mentors gradually transition students to college-style self-directed learning. Students guide this transition, earning more scheduling choice as they make responsible study decisions.  Project-Based Learning  To prepare students for 21st-century careers, Kairos coursework trades mindless memorization for creative, hands-on projects. The world is our classroom, and students learn about it firsthand through experiential field trips and internships.  Civic Leadership  Kairos students do more than just talk about leadership. They practice it by leading study groups, extracurricular clubs, and student government. From mediating peer discipline to advising our school board, students own more than just their schedules and education—they own their community.",1,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MWm5QU3BDPDPndjifEsaUMRnsO23BVDXuLf_8GoDRJg/edit#slide=id.g1f23d6273ef_0_24,0,,,,0,,,,,,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,Jack Krewson,Chief Strategy Officer,jack.krewson@kairosacademies.org

Our preferred future of learning recognizes the contributions of all to teach learners in a flexible, adaptive, and culturally-responsive method. The current system places focus on assessment scores in order to fund and provide opportunities for progress in education. State, national, and cognitive assessments focus on the deficits of a learner, institution or potential future. Present models in education tend to be deficit-based. They highlight the problems of a child, such as a child’s (dis)ability and focus on what is “missing” instead of what can be accomplished. Deficit-based models lead to a downward spiral of burnout and depression among students and staff. Our preferred future of learning focuses on the individual learner with an asset-based approach, highlighting their individual strengths and designing a curriculum based on their needs and desired future.   Our preferred future centers on a curriculum that commits to justice and equity. Our preferred future curriculum recognizes the collective impacts of all members in society and champions their contributions. This future understands that there will be constant work toward a more perfect union and provides all learners with an authentic education focused on the diverse cultures of our world. We will center our curriculum development on justice and equity, highlighting the lost voices of the past in our readings, videos, and learning materials. We will enable every learner and their family to flourish by centering the instruction on their individual needs and progress. The team-effort in the child’s instruction will allow all voices to be heard and will focus on the child’s abilities and needs in order to succeed in their future. Our just future includes a curriculum as diverse as our world in voices and materials where every learner has the voice to determine their criteria for success.   Our work focuses on student engagement in universal individualized educational programs using a Montessori educational theory based curriculum with instructional sources from global perspectives. An Individualized Learning Program (ILP) is developed for each child. This allows for a team approach to a child’s education and will document both successes and goals toward the progress of each individual child. Finally, we seek to emerge by providing all children a Glocal Curriculum (Hale & Fisher, 2013). Children learn locally, but seek to make change globally in the world. In order to accomplish this, we need to ensure that the curriculum is a global curriculum, providing for diverse perspectives and experiences.  We see evidence of improving the curriculum through resources like the 1619 Project (New York Times, 2019). By using multiple media, articles, live events, podcasts, the project sought to reframe the country’s history and highlight the contributions of Black Americans in the United States.

AIM Academy students thrive in classrooms that offer multisensory and experiential learning and our programs are designed to foster self-esteem and social responsibility. Their academic and intellectual development is further enhanced by an array of extracurricular activities and enrichment in the arts, athletics and community service. It is our goal, that upon graduation, our students are prepared for the challenges, complexities and choices available to them at university and beyond. Curiosity, collaboration, compassion, confidence and critical thinking are their tools for success.  The AIM Institute for Learning & Research is a center for educational excellence and professional development providing teachers and professionals who work with children who learn differently with specialized training programs and access to the latest research and best practices for the classroom.

We empower students of all abilities to find strength in their community, believe in the power of their ideas, and influence action in the world around them.  Our small, mixed age classes create a loving environment where each student builds a strong relationship with the peers and educator resulting in a deeper and richer educational experience.  We meet students at their level and create the right amount of challenge for them to achieve their goals while loving learning. Content is not age or grade specific, it is student specific.  We believe that a good educational model isn’t everyone getting the same thing, it's everyone getting what they need to be successful and thrive.   Deep, interdisciplinary project based learning contributes to the magic of Up Academy.  Students engage in meaningful projects that allow them to engage authentically in their community to solve problems.   Over the course of a trimester the students are able to grow in wonder as they make discoveries and explore their topic through hands-on activities and field trips.   Each project culminates with an exhibition day, where the students get to demonstrate their learning and craftsmanship.   Our students focus on developing their own identities as individuals and an understanding of who they are as Americans in a global world, humans in a diverse ecosystem, and critical questioners in an ever changing environment.

Each week, students will have the chance to meet one-on-one with their advisor, as well as participate in community-building activities. All courses are A-G approved and count as full credits towards their California and Ednovate graduation requirements. Students will have a learning pod assigned to them for each of their four core classes. Learning pods will be run by a certified Ednovate teacher who will facilitate live learning through the use of mini-lessons, small groups and tiered interventions, shared experiences, and peer collaboration. Flex time will give students more freedom to choose how to spend their time. Students may have mandatory appointments such as special education services, tutoring, college counseling, or one-on-one meetings with their advisor. However, students will also have some choice on how to spend their time during their flex time. For example, students can choose to work on elective courses, work on PMC Journey projects, get tutoring, go to events to earn PMC hours, or even help their family with responsibilities.  Students have daily advisory in cohorts between 15-25 students to build community and engage in socio-emotional check-ins as a group. Advisors will be provided with baseline materials for academic support for students (grade trackers, etc), as well as virtual advisory materials. Advisors will also be able to support students through targeted interventions when needed. Additionally, each student will have a bi-weekly one-on-one check-in with their advisor to set and support goals. Monthly, there will be at least one school-wide community-building event for students to learn, engage, and celebrate.

The idea is to establish an environment where the whole child-- all parts of their identity-- are considered with intentional empathy and rigor to help them grow academically and as leaders.   Additionally, we support college and career readiness through the intentional development of a pathway to concurrent enrollment courses early in the High School Experience. There are career and mentorship opportunities through our Enrichment programming twice a week during the school day; we partner with local organizations to curate experiences for scholars to receive instruction in areas of interest like audio production, cybersecurity certification, coding and programming, and cultural exploration. Competency as measured by the ACCUplacer exam is a graduation requirement for our school district. We administer the assessment within the first 6 weeks of our scholars' High School experience as 9th graders. This serves as a benchmark for where they are in terms of accomplishing a graduation requirement and allows us to begin planning for the Spring semester course selections. Scholars who demonstrate competency become eligible for enrollment in courses that bear High School and College credit (Concurrent Enrollment). The ultimate goal is to ensure as many scholars as are eligible are able to take at least one Concurrent Enrollment Course and 35% of each graduating class will leave High School with an Associates Degree.",1,https://youtu.be/VfkP0NTMDV0,0,,,,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Shakira Abney-Wisdom,Founding Principal,s_abney-wisdom5@dpsk12.net

Scholars will find their purpose and passion so that they can cultivate the critical hope, optimism and leadership essential to be catalysts in their community and world.  ​ Because of this, we intentionally create school environments that prepare our scholars to be leaders and change-makers.

At Catalyst, we are reimagining school to ensure our scholars are prepared for the future.   At Catalyst: Bremerton scholars develop the agency to lead their own learning alongside their peers.  We leverage a co-teaching model to offer small group and student lead instruction in grades from Kindergarten through 8th grade.  Hallmarks of the student experience at Catalyst: Bremerton include a daily class called Sunrise.  During Sunrise scholars explore the school's BRAVE values (Belonging, Resilience, Achievement, Vulnerability, and Enthusiasm) and participate in social emotional learning including mindfulness.  Another important element of our student experience is a course called Change Maker Space (CMS).

Vision: Happy Kids, Engaged in Healthy Relationships, on a Path to Gainful Employment.   Our Approach:   Signature design elements at all grade levels will serve as a catalyst for creating interest-based, authentic learning opportunities unique to each student. Design elements include:  Advisory  Often described as a “second family” by students, an advisory is a core organizational and relational structure that nurtures belonging. Learners stay with an advisor and a group of fellow classmates for multiple years, building close personal relationships that last a lifetime. Advisory experiences intentionally cultivate a learner-centered mindset by inspiring learners to develop the agency, skills, dispositions, and abilities needed to take charge of their learning journey. Advisors stand alongside students as they explore their passions and interests and help students turn challenges into learning opportunities.  Competency-based  Each student is a unique individual with knowledge, skills, and dispositions developed through learning experiences inside and outside school. Our competency-based system creates equitable learning structures and conditions that empower each student to meet rigorous, common expectations for learning through timely, differentiated support. Central to our approach is an intense focus on student growth through meaningful feedback and permission for them to show how they are progressing in many ways.  World of Work A national leader in early childhood career development, the Cajon Valley World of Work initiative engages students in hands-on experience right in their classrooms with a wide variety of careers, preparing them for their futures. World of Work uses each student’s interests, values, and strengths to tailor exploration, simulations, and virtual field trips with career professionals. Beginning in the Freshman year, all high school and post-secondary students will leverage early childhood interest exploration to identify and serve off-campus internships with highly qualified mentors. Local partners such as San Diego Workforce Partnership and Biocom are already playing a role in defining World of Work opportunities and engaging with our students.  Difference Making On-campus studio exploration empowers student entrepreneurs, makers, and inventors to impact their communities and world through their work and ideas. Students engage in community-based projects that tap their interests and strengths to make a meaningful difference in others’ lives. Their impact is amplified by our school’s multilingual, multiliterate, and multicultural approach to learning. An example may include designing, building, and installing an equine sensory trail for children with autism.  Family Connection Accomplishing our vision challenges us to think differently about how we work together with students, families, and our community. Truly personalizing education beyond mere academic work involves looking at each student holistically. Families know their children best and they must play a proactive role in their children’s learning, collaborating in the planning and assessment of their student’s work.  Reimagining Postsecondary  Our goal is to push beyond dual and concurrent enrollment in community college to a coherent TK-14 experience, moving toward a strengths-based, truly personalized postsecondary experience that results in gainful employment opportunities in our immediate community. It is not our intent to partner with a community college to mirror or offer their program. Rather, create an integrated approach that builds on our World of Work initiative by extending internship and coursework beyond high school. Post high school students will maintain a relationship with an industry mentor and receive “wrap-around” services. Their Bostonia advisor, social worker, career counselor, and support staff will ensure an Associates’ degree and/or certificate of completion.",0,,0,,,,0,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,Nerel Winter,CEO,wintern@cajonvalley.net

With the goal of developing students into independent and influential citizens within their local and global communities, BELIEVE has intentionally designed supports and programming that meet the needs of our families and students.   Instruction & Curriculum Double Blocked ELA: Our double-blocked ELA sequence in 9th and 10th grade supports students by accelerating their completion of high school course credit requirements as well as remediating any learning gaps from students’ K-8 instruction, and creating more flexibility for career certification courses.  Gifted & Talented Accelerated Track: We recognize that while some students enter high school with significant learning gaps, others enter high school ready for greater challenges and having already earned some high school math credit. We support students who are ready for advanced learning by adjusting their schedules to enroll them in dual enrollment courses and higher level high school math courses as early as ninth grade. While many large high schools offer accelerated paths for gifted and talented students, BELIEVE provides a gifted and talented option within the attentive and close-knit setting of a small school.    Montessori Principles: In the Montessori model, the child directs their own learning pathway. BSTLA mirrors this in the Villages model that each student is a part of from the time they enroll at BELEIVE.   Individualized Learning Plan: Within a school community, the learning needs are as many and varied as the students. Although we believe that all students should have access to instruction that is informed by the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), we also believe that all students should have access to high school learning pathways that best meet their individual needs and goals. At BELIEVE, we take a student-centered approach to scheduling, in alignment with our “Child-Centered” school value. Each students’ schedule is made by hand, and is informed by both qualitative and quantitative data.   Culture  BELIEVE’s culture system is unique and truly one of a kind. As it was created and developed by the founding team and refined over the first two years of operation, expectation and culture systems are designed specifically for the students that we serve. Mirroring the standard corporate ladder, the Level Up System (LUS), was designed to provide students with real-world expectations and practices so they are prepared for life after college. The LUS was crafted to help students develop autonomy and agency so they can be self-sufficient, starters, and critical thinkers. This system, or the privileges accessed through it, are common in affluent neighborhoods and districts; however, not in black and brown communities. BELIEVE is changing that. The following are core pieces of our culture system that help support the whole child:   -Village Model -Social Emotional Learning -College, Community, and Career Programming",1,"Over the course of the 21-22 school year, BELIEVE Circle City High School celebrated many wins! Throughout the year, BELIEVE scholars showed up to school each day, hitting a 92% daily attendance rate consistently throughout all four quarters of the school year. This undoubtedly aided in the amount of total credits our scholars earned. With very little credit loss, 99% of BELIEVE scholars are on track to earn all credits needed for the Core 40 diploma. In conjunction with high school credits earned, BELIEVE scholars have also earned a total of 314 college credits in just two years! We are proud to say that our scholars have saved a combined $92,944 towards a traditional in-state 4-yr tuition! We are pleased with our scholars’ growth on the SAT this school year. In August 2021, our ninth-grade scholars’ mean composite score on the SAT was 721, and in May 2022 their mean score was 796–demonstrating an average growth of 75 points. Our ninth-grade scholars made their strongest growth in EBRW (evidence-based reading and writing), averaging 46 points of growth on the reading and writing sections of the SAT. Our tenth-grade scholars earned a mean composite score of 768 when they took the SAT in August 2021. When they took the SAT in May 2022, their mean score had risen to 830–demonstrating an average growth of 62 points. Our tenth-grade scholars made their largest gains in math, averaging 42 points of growth on the math sections of the SAT test. Overall, we are pleased with our scholars’ growth, as it outpaces what CollegeBoard deems typical annual growth*. With 100% of our instructional staff returning for a second consecutive year, we excitedly anticipate even more growth in the 22-23 academic year!   *CollegeBoard’s grade-level SAT benchmarks indicate that ninth graders should typically grow 40 composite points in one year, and tenth graders should typically grow 50 composite points in one year.",0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,Angel Jackson-Anderson,Principal,aanderson@believeschools.org

At a time when many teachers were leaving the teaching profession and schools were seeing high rates of staff turnover, 92 percent of Creative Minds teachers who were invited to return for the 2022–23 school year accepted the offer.  When the school COVID-19 level was highest, the lab served more than 250 students per day for our test-to-stay program. Through this program, asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-positive individuals could remain at school by testing negative for COVID-19. On average, 90 percent of close contacts participated in test-to-stay, allowing them not to miss critical in-person learning time.  Creative Minds scored at the highest level, “Meets Requirements,” on its IDEA determination rating. This rating reflects the evaluation of a school’s special-education program, in two areas: annual Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) compliance requirements and key student-progress measures.

We achieve this approach in four powerful ways:  1. Joyfully Rigorous Learning. I Dream PCS learners learn how to learn. They engage in learning that makes them think deeply and delve into challenging text and math problems like detectives. They experiment, write, problem-solve, and research independently and with their peers and adults (called “coaches” instead of “teachers”) to learn Common Core State Standards and to answer their questions about themselves and the world around them. It’s the challenges that make them grow and learn who they are.  2. Dream Time. I Dream PCS learners have weekly Dream Time to identify and explore a curiosity or interest they want to learn about. Curiosity breeds deep learning and innovation. Coaches working with learners conference with and observe them in Dream Time to document the skills learners use in their deep learning and to guide them to transfer the skills and knowledge to their academic learning, or apply the Common Core State Standards they learn in academic classes in Dream Time.   3. Social-Emotional Learning. Research shows that learners who engage in social-emotional learning demonstrate better academic performance, positive attitudes and reduced stress. I Dream PCS learners meet daily in Community Time with their coaches and classmates to develop their emotional intelligence and healthy relationships with themselves and others.  4. Customized learning. A Customized Learning Plan (CLP) is a living document created with each learner, their family and coaches to identify learning targets and action steps towards mastery of math, literacy, social-emotional learning, and dreamer goals. CLPs are a learner-centered assessment practice to build ownership of learning through continuous goal-setting, reflection and mastery of standards.

Global Citizens opened in Ward 7 to provide children and their families living east of the Anacostia River with equitable access to dual language immersion programs.  The mission of Global Citizens PCS is to inspire and prepare the next generation of global citizens.  We will do this by supporting students, ages 3-11, to reach their full academic and leadership potential in a nurturing learning environment.  We will immerse them in the Mandarin and Spanish languages, promote the value of diversity, and equip them with the knowledge, skills, and mindsets they need to contribute to a better world.  We envision academic excellence, language acquisition, and authentic inclusion of a diverse student population.  We will build a strong community of learners who are confident in their ability to communicate in the Chinese, Spanish, and English languages.  Our children will use language to liberate and advocate for themselves and those most marginalized.  All of our children will develop a sense of self and a sense of belonging, build empathy and emotional resilience, learn to understand and appreciate diverse perspectives, and challenge themselves to take action to improve the world.",0,,0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Natalie Smith, Ph.D.",Founder + CEO | Head of School,natalie@globalcitizensschool.org

We put all of this together through our Real-world Project-based Learning, where students learn not only from their teachers and peers, but also directly from scientists, lawyers, engineers, and designers.",0,0,2,0,3,0,1,6,7,0,5,4,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,1,,0,73,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,1,0,0,1,0,,0,0,1,0,,0,1,94,2,0,0,0,3,10,164,3,1,1,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GHdOnn_1U1omNBtZgs9EVS26RvMqHVqEpFMAN3mJQNA/edit?usp=share_link,1,0,,0,,,"- Honoring Identities: Our school honors students' identities and creates the predictable, safe learning environment students need to grow into their leadership. - Exceptional Teaching: We honor our teachers as professionals with high-quality teaching materials and significant time for collaborative planning and learning from each other. - Collaborative Partnerships: We treat our families and community as the valuable experts they are, and strengthen our school through early, frequent, and thorough partnerships. - Building Leadership: Through goal setting, reflection, and intentional skill development, teachers and students engage in the skills we need to collaborate and lead. - Rigor & Relevance: Our students have rich, complex experiences in humanities, math, and science to empower them to be critical thinkers and creative problem solvers. - Real-world Projects: Our teachers partner with community experts to create real-world learning.

Valor is a hybrid school, so that means we let an online program with lots of formative data set the floor(foundation) and the teachers who are with the student set the ceiling.  For the students, they will feel empowered to apply learning in the the classrooms and out of school with teachers who have demonstrated a connection to their lives.  Students will develop the self-advocacy and agency to choose how much help or structure they want outside of class time.     To do this use an instructional model that is color coded with blue and red connected as hexagons resembling a beehive to show interdependence.  The Red is what online does for the students, families, teachers, admin and blue is what the humans bring to the experience.  This is an essential step because a good hybrid plan must have that well described and delineated so our amazing teachers aren’t do what a course management system with good formative assessments can do.",0,,0,,,,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Dan Mahlandt,Principal,dan.mahlandt@valoraz.org

For our graduate aims, we intend for students to have the following when they leave Prospect:  1) Mindsets: a growth mindset where they don't give up when things are hard or they aren't sure how to do something, but they learn how to use resources around them to help them learn or come to the answer.  This mindset would also encourage them to love the process, which we are trying to model as a staff (in the start-up phase!).  2) Knowledge: basic knowledge from the 5th - 8th grade standards and/or more than 4 grade levels worth of growth from beginning to end of their time at Prospect (if attending Prospect for 3 - 4 years), with the goal of having basic math, reading, and writing skills to be functional adults with jobs, and/or the necessary reading, math, and writing skills to succeed in high school and beyond.   3) Skills: ability to track learning, measure their learning, and analyze their learning; increase in executive function skills around organization and self-regulation, collaboration with others, and friendship-making skills, increase in skills related to self-compassion and self-understanding / reflection; increase in empathy towards others",1,0,,0,,,"At Prospect, our learning environment aims to be as personalized and supportive as possible.  Students experience success and build off that success to create a new narrative about their learning.  We group students by skill level in reading, writing, and math, which helps them learn at their current level and gives them confidence that they can learn.  We empower students to analyze their own data and learning trajectories using Precision Teaching, and this also helps us ensure essential skills are learned with fluency, not just accuracy.  We regularly check progress through use of Curriculum-Based Measurements, which is another celebration of student growth - and growth is a big focus for us.    Additionally, we have a dedicated movement block and social-emotional learning time each day, and our goal is for the concepts from these classes to be integrated into academic classes across the day.  These classes equip our learners with other skills that are essential for success.",1,"Testimonials:   1) J's not stressed, he's way less anxious, and he said to her """"I don't feel stupid anymore"""".  She also mentioned that he used to go to school all day and then come home and have to do all his work at home that he didn't get done at school bc he didn't know how to do it.  He was so stressed out that he was pulling out his hair.  He's not doing that anymore and his hair has been growing back.    2) From our Speech-Language Pathologist: it was really powerful to be in J's IEP meeting. Inspired me to keep pushing, even on overwhelming days--His mom was brought to tears expressing the myriad ways J is a DIFFERENT KID (in a good way) since starting at Prospect. I was humbled to be on Prospect staff today. Thank you all for being you and doing the HARD work. You are making a difference!  3)S shared something with us about school last week and we thought it was worth passing on.  First, I should say that getting S to talk about school at all is a task in and of itself. He's always enjoyed school but when he's not there he doesn't really see the point in discussing it.  J got him talking about school one evening last week where he really opened up and had lots to share.  They talked about mitochondria, ribosomes, logos, ethos, pathos, recess, lunch all sorts of fun topics.  In the midst of all that S said (I'm paraphrasing) that the teachers at Prospect seem really willing to help him learn.   We can't stress what a groundbreaking conversation this was.  He shared about his day, talked about actual learning, and made the observation that the teachers around him are helping him along the way.  It literally brought tears to our eyes.   Thank you so much to you and your awesome staff!  We cannot overstate how happy and blessed we feel to have S at Prospect.  It is obvious you are all working so hard and we are so grateful!  He loves being there and we're so excited for his future at that school.   4) L and A no longer have anxiety about school. They are enjoying it and we believe they have found their place.   There used to be crying at night and blow ups over school anxiety. No more...It has been a huge blessing. Thank you so much for pushing through to make this school a reality.   Quick question: after the first few months, is it still feasible to expand your grade offerings in fall 2023? The reason I ask is because we eventually want all our children at Prospect.   Thank you again! I hope this brings some encouragement this weekend.

She goes to school happy and comes home happy. -Smaller class sizes and more attentive teachers. -I believe wholeheartedly in the teaching and learning philosophies at Phoenix Modern. I’ve seen first hand how invested the guides/admin are in seeing children grow and succeed. Through every learning curve you come out stronger - PM is more than a school, it’s become a community and family for us. That is incredibly valuable and special for my children. -My kids get more attention at Phoenix Modern, they're happier because they have more choice and the overall feel of the school. The classrooms and facility are great. -[The guide] has done a tremendous job reinvigorating Atticus' interest in learning, and he appears to be steadily closing any gaps in his math education.  -In our experience at PHX Modern, the staff strive to live up to the school's values and the whole-child approach to learning approach is implemented very well. -Everyone is so kind and helpful. My kid loves coming to school. My children are happy to go to school come home excited to share what they have learned -I used to try and fake being sick so I wouldn’t have to go to school. [Our daughter] is heartbroken if she is actually sick and has to miss a day. It’s a huge difference -Small environment, small classes, focus on providing best practices and relationships Although Phoenix Modern is a wonderful place to learn, the teacher turnover rate has been very high. The amount of time children are learning on devices rathe than being taught or collaborating with others is no longer happening. Learner/Guide/Studio and Core Methodology No music nor foreign language, and minimum science and social science is covered. Very few after school classes were offered (compared to public school districts and other charter schools) likely due to limited funding. We are finding that our child has not progressed much academically in past few months ...other than in math and English from working on computer apps. We are compering this to Qual Run Elementary school where Zana attended the kindergarten and 1st grade. She demonstrated more ownership over her learning and desire to learn a year ago than in past few months here. We are giving another couple months before deciding whether to enroll her for the next school year here or at her prior school. The boys are excelling in everything they were struggling with at public school, including reading and making friends. Amazing educational opportunity I love the school over all and the foundation. Too much Chromebook teaching instead of teacher teaching Mae & Christopher’s youngest sister is turning 5 y/o and I want to enroll her into kindergarten. 23/24 The school has a great culture. We love the learner-led environment We recommend Phoenix Modern to so many families! This is how we describe it: We never expected to find a school in Phoenix that we truly loved, but we did in Phoenix Modern. We love your whole child approach. We love the flexibility in how children are allowed to reach their goals.

Staff and students greet each other alike.  “Ask Me About” signs hang outside of each classroom with three topics to encourage conversations.  Social contracts are developed as a group and signed by both students and staff. Positive relationships is key to the success of all programs and stakeholders.  The CLK Engage program is designed to create a learning environment where teachers are shared.  Students and staff begin their day by having all three classes come together for “Morning Meeting.”  Inspirational quotes and character lessons are incorporated in the “Morning Meeting” to inspire, motivate and teach positive behavior expectations before launching the students into their language arts groups.  After lunch and recess, the students are also launched into their math groups.  At the end of the day, all of the students and staff come together again to celebrate good things for what they call “launch.”  “Morning Meeting” and “Launch” provide opportunities for all students to come together to build positive relationships with all three teachers.  CLK Engage has also implemented “Fun Fridays.”  At the end of the day on Friday, students have the opportunity to choose the classroom they would like to spend their time based on the activity the teacher is offering.  Parents and community members also provide additional support to offer additional choices to students as well.  The idea behind “Fun Fridays” is to provide students more voice and choice with their learning based on their individual interests.",0,,1,CLK Elementary Goal Reporting 2022-2023.pdf,F_2SkQnfUBeXTPANI,52120,1,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Matthew Hampton,CLK Elementary Principal,mhampton@clkschools.org

That’s what our name stands for, and when you visit you’ll see why.   We are a single-site public charter school in Austin, serving sixteen hundred students PreK through 12.   We were founded by families in 1998 to serve the whole student, and that mission remains.   We are a school where students feel safe being and becoming who they are and want to be.   We support students on their individual pathway to college, career, or military readiness.   NYOS focuses on cultivating responsibility, confidence, compassion, and independence among all students.    We consistently receive the highest ratings from the Texas Education agency.   We consistently rank in the US News and World Report as a top high school nationwide and a top charter school nationwide.   The appeal of a NYOS education is strong; 2500 families are currently on our waitlist. 	 Here are the key features of our school design:  First, small class size.   NYOS classes are capped at 20.   Classes are often as small as 12 students, by design.   Second, seven hours of teacher-controlled time per week - almost a full day equivalent.  With this time, teachers plan, assess data, collaborate, and grow.   Third, two-year loops.  Students keep the same teacher for two years.   And finally, a year-round schedule sets a better pace for learning and makes the school year sustainable for staff.",0,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Blanca Martinez,Community Outreach,bmartinez@nyos.org

Often students experience rigid schedules and space in addition to siloed subjects. This means that schools cannot address meaningful community problems, individuals' needs cannot be met, and schools are often unable to include students in authentic decisions. Teachers often work hard to make learning relevant and personalized, but are constrained in this model. This leads to negative outcomes, disengagement, and students acting out.  To meet the diverse needs and aspirations of all students, Exploration High School is designed for flexibility, focused on four areas: time, space, roles, and goals. Having a more flexible schedule allows students to spend time in pursuit of mastery, self-discovery, and service. We learn from experts in the community and create a flexible space that tends towards collaboration. Students are Explorers who design their unique learning pathway with guidance, structure, and support. Adults are facilitators who advocate, celebrate, and empower every Explorer to thrive now and in the future.",0,,0,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,Dave Heighington,School Director,dave.heighington@explorationhighschool.org

Possi supports goal-setting, college and career planning, and strong engagement with families to support learner growth. Competency-based: Student grades are based upon their PERFORMANCE. Learning goals are organized as “competencies” - the knowledge and skills learners must successfully apply in order to solve real world problems. Learners only advance once they have demonstrated proficiency of the learning goals. We have written Common Core/Next Generation Science and C3 aligned “Continua” which are competency specific rubrics written as “I can” statements, for educators and students to have common conversations about progress and performance. Personalized learning: Students have access to their learning at all times. We offer students that are ready the opportunity to move at their own pace, once they prove ready to advance through their learning independently!

Ricky is in the automotive program at River Bend; graphics arts is a personal hobby that he’s made into a small business, even though River Bend offers a computer graphics program. The mix of interests across learning disciplines stands out and Ricky is adept in both fields.  His winning entry was selected by a group of three judges, all professionals in either graphic arts or marketing.  One judge remarked, “I think the logo captures the sense of Vermont and it manages to get everything in—the name and its establishment in a good package.”  Another called it clean and professional.  They all agreed the winning logo is well suited to multiple applications: T-shirts, hats, the webpage, brochures, trail signs, and others.""""  """"Students are so busy moving around and doing that they don't get bored!""""  """"It’s funny how one event in your life can lead to a decision that takes you down a certain path into your future!  This happened to this month’s “River Bend Career and Technical Center Salutes Person”, Sergeant Rachel Harrness of the Grafton County Department of Corrections.  Growing up, Rachel had always felt good about helping others, and found that she was friendly with many people.  She really wasn’t sure where this enjoyment of helping others would lead her until middle school.  Rachel attended middle school at Oxbow High School, and when she was an 8th grader, the school ran a program for all students to shadow some sort of career.  Rachel chose the opportunity to participate in a “ride-along” with the Haverhill Police Department.  From that experience, she became focused on careers in the “helping professions”, which has led her to where she is today! In her junior year at Oxbow, Rachel decided to take a new program at River Bend Career and Technical Center called “Emergency Services”.  She completed this exciting two-year program in 2002, and graduated from Oxbow High School at the same time. As she reflects back on that education, she feels that there were many foundational skills that she picked up through her technical education that have served her well over the years.  A few of the “stand-out” experiences include her week-long training at the Vermont Police Academy, which was completed along with students from Hartford Career and Technical Center; the time spent doing “live-burns” at the Vermont Fire Academy; and the connections she made by joining the Bradford Fire Department and the Bradford FAST Squad in her senior year.  She left the River Bend program at graduation having completed """"",0,,,,0,1,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,Brian R Emerson,Director,brian.emerson@oesu.org

The learning environment allows students to develop in these areas in multiple ways. Students participate in daily circle activities where they can deepen their understanding of themselves and their community. We use restorative practices to repair and minimize harm, allowing for student's to develop a myriad of personal skills. Students co-create curriculum at the beginning of each year with their teachers. This includes, but is not limited to, proposing topics, self-assessing their own work, developing their own projects and courses, and leading learning activities themselves. We also design our curricula to maximize credit-earning opportunities within a competency-based model, which helps students who are under-credited for their age can catch up and move forward. Finally, Next STEP staff constantly seeks to push students out into the Lewiston community to engage in real-world projects.

Our strong vision is rooted in our core belief that each unique learner at St. John Paul II has gifts to celebrate and that every child can achieve at high levels.  In partnership with the University of Notre Dame, we use blended learning, which combines targeted, personalized online lessons, small-group learning, and classroom instruction to fill the gaps in each scholar’s knowledge.  At the same time, our teachers employ instructional methods that help every scholar successfully work with rigorous grade-level material.  This ensures that each child, at every academic level, will experience growth with the goal of reaching grade level proficiency.  Our scholars take ownership of their education and collaborate with teachers to create individual learning plans that identify their goals for academic growth and incorporate parent participation.  We continually measure scholar growth, which allows us to determine the specific areas in which a scholar needs more care and attention.  We partner with families to prepare each scholar for high school success, with expectations that they will graduate and seek higher education.

Each term, students further develop these competencies while gaining exposure to a variety of themes and issues. At the heart of NuVu’s curriculum are studios, a series of immersive, interdisciplinary, three- to four-week projects. In a typical trimester, a student will participate in two different studios designed by our team of expert coaches. Each trimester ends with an open innovation period during which students have the freedom to dig deeper into a topic of particular interest from earlier in the term.  In studios designed for younger students, our coaches focus on supporting the development of foundational skills and creative confidence. As students learn to navigate open-ended problems, collaborate effectively, build empathy for others and communicate their ideas using a variety of media, studios become more sophisticated. This process eventually prepares each student to complete a 12th grade Capstone Project on a topic of their choosing.

Modern learners have the chance to create and forge meaningful learning experiences and connect with the world around them.  We recognize that the emergence of technology provides boundless access to information and opportunities to create, design, and invent. Technology also connects learners on a local and global level, to foster communication, collaboration, and creativity. Students now, more than ever, are equipped with the tools to innovate, to reimagine their education, and to serve as pioneers in both existing and new fields.   Preparing students for an unpredictable future requires a variety of knowledge, skills, and dispositions. -As global citizens, students must be able to demonstrate an understanding of others’ needs and understand the value of a diversity of experiences, cultures, and perspectives. -As solution seekers they need to be able to recognize obstacles, diagnose the issues that limit progress, apply strategies to address their concerns, and reflect on the effectiveness of their response. -As skillful collaborators, students to work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams in a variety of formats. -As inspired innovators, they need to be able to elaborate, refine, analyze, evaluate, and iterate their ideas in order to maximize their creative efforts. -As mindful learners, they need to be able to regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they persist toward personal and learning goals. -As effective communicators, they must articulate and listen with attention to knowledge, values, attitudes, and intentions.  Although we recognize the changing realities of the modern world, there are current aspects of our professional work that remain important for the future of Nipmuc. We must continue to provide students with opportunities to be introduced to key content and knowledge needed to ignite their passions, broaden their understanding, and develop cultural literacy. We also recognize that we need to continue to prepare our students to achieve in traditional forms of assessment that are valued by colleges and employers.  ​Because traditional achievement is only one measure of success, we must expand our definition to include moments of reflection, resilience, creativity, collaboration, experimentation, and inspiration.   As our world evolves, our professional practices must reflect and include opportunities to collaborate, reflect, innovate, and initiate.  Students should be encouraged to seek novel approaches to learning. As educators, we must continually reflect, review, and revise our professional work to make sure our work supports our definition of learning, beliefs about learning, and the vision of our graduates.",1,bit.ly/nipmucroadmap,0,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,John K.

The rubric is used for English, Science and Social Studies. The rubric provides students the opportunity to show true grade level understanding, meaning that a student might be in 5th grade but has mastery in certain standards on a 4th-grade level, while other standards are on a 7th-grade level.

A safe learning environment provided a physical and emotional space where students feel secure and protected, allowing them to focus on their learning without fear of harm or discrimination. This is achieved through positive discipline behavior practices, clear expectations, and a commitment to addressing and preventing bullying. Our supportive learning environment fosters a sense of belonging and encourages students to take risks and try new things. Teachers have created this environment through positive relationships with students, active engagement in the learning process, and a focus on student strengths and interests.  We have focused on creating an engaging learning environment that captures students' attention and holds their interest, making them excited about coming to school and eager to learn. This has been achieved through hands-on activities, interactive technology, and opportunities for students to pursue their passions and interests.  Our teachers foster a challenging learning environment that sets high expectations and provides students with opportunities to stretch their abilities and grow their skills. This has be achieved through differentiated instruction, opportunities for independent and collaborative work, and a focus on higher-order thinking and problem-solving.

Our curriculum focuses on student-centered, project-based learning and we use restorative practices to cultivate our community.   Project-Based Learning is the natural way to learn. Students set their own learning goals in order to meet the graduation requirements of the school. At Escuela Verde, students develop, research, work, and produce their own projects—they meet learning on their own terms.  In practice, Project-Based Learning means:  Students design their own learning projects, with their advisor’s advice and guidance. Primary focus is on a constructivist pedagogy: students self-determine what and how they want to learn. Small advisories that make for plenty of personal attention. Students and educational advisors co-develop a Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) that meets the needs of the student. All students graduate prepared for post-secondary education, workplace, and active citizenship.  Escuela Verde students are encouraged to incorporate YPEAR into their projects, and it is a cornerstone of the Senior Capstone Project required to graduate. YPEAR is an acronym for Youth Participatory Ecojustice Action Research. It is based on the practice of YPAR (Youth Participatory Action Research), which takes young people out into their communities to identify problems and propose solutions. YPEAR allows young people to specifically focus on environmental justice issues.",0,,0,,,,0,,1,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,Christina Dyson,Collaborative Leader,Christina@escuelaverde.org

Let’s start with a story.  “How can we reduce the environmental and social impact of our shops?” The managers of Pinwheel Coffee and Framework Cycles asked this to Embark students early in the school year. And, they spent the next two months answering it. Students started with an environmental audit of the shops. They identified issues like plastic and paper use, rubber and metal waste, production of coffee, tea, and milk, and materials that bikes and components are made of, among other things.   In many places, the learning would stop there but at Embark we strive to go deeper. Guided by the educators, students explored their chosen issue. In science, they tackled topics such as properties of matter, chemical change, and erosion. In social studies, they identified countries where key products are grown, mined, or produced. They researched government structures and policies related to their issue to understand the impact.  What really sets Embark apart is that the learning and work has real meaning and impact.  Students used their research to create formal presentations to the shop managers. Once accepted, students got to actually implement their recommendations in the shops. Students wrote the text and designed posters to inform Pinwheel patrons about why almond milk now costs extra. They worked with bike manufacturers to stock new more sustainable brands at Framework. They worked with the local government and nonprofits to create a rubber recycling program for used bike tubes. In short, they made real change happen.",1,https://exchange.transcendeducation.org/models/embark-education/  https://www.embarkeducation.org/blog,0,,,,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Megan Parry,Director of Embark Education,meganp@embarkeducation.org

This statement recognizes that every student brings their unique abilities, interests, needs, circumstances, and context into school and into their learning. At Durango Big Picture High School, each student is part of an advisory, a learning community, led by a supportive advisor who guides students to identify their needs and interests which are in turn formed into negotiated learning plans and goals that make learning personal, engaging, and relevant. A student-driven curriculum is developed around real world experiences, relevant competencies, and standards-driven learning targets. The student is the curriculum and the school is the community.  All students are challenged to pursue their interests and are supported by a community of educators, professionals, and family members. Big Picture Learning supports the concept of ‘leaving-to-learn’ which enables the powerful learning that occurs when students leave their school as part of the school program to expand and deepen their learning, to get exposure to new ideas, people and opportunities, and to learn through their interests in the best places where those interests are happening - in real-world settings and workplaces in relationship with adults.  “We know that learning happens best when interests, relationships, and practice are woven together. People learn more quickly, more deeply, more comprehensively, and more meaningfully when they are pursuing their interests with skilled people who know them and let them practice, play, make mistakes, start over again, ask more questions, test things out and then show what they can do.” – Elliot Washer BPL’s relational rather than transactional approach to youth helps them learn about who they are and how they can best contribute.

Our team approaches high school differently. We invest in every aspect of our students’ lives to prepare them with the tools, support, and connections they need to thrive. We focus on practical projects instead of tests and partner with leaders in New Mexico’s ACE industries to get everyone learning on their feet rather than cramped behind a desk. We all know the world of work is changing, and education should too. That’s why we’re building a better future together.   We are caring.  At ACE, we make sure every student gets one-on-one support. Our school is a safe and caring place   where students discover their unique strengths, grow, and thrive. As a community, we believe in the power of courage, integrity, and purpose. We hold each other accountable and bring out the best in each other so that we can build a better future together.   We are grounded. ACE offers practical experiences and expert connections that prepare our students for success in life and work. We are free, local, and public, and we have been firmly grounded in our community since 2010. At ACE we pair hands-on projects with highly engaged teachers and staff.  We make sure that every student — whether returning to school after an absence, raising a family, or holding down a job — has the individualized support they need to succeed.  We are connected. At ACE, we know that when we work as a team, everyone wins. That’s why we build connections between students, educators, community partners, and industry leaders to bring out the best in all of us. We actively engage with our local neighborhoods to provide resources and support for a healthy community. Every year we connect ACE students to industry leaders for mentorship and real life learning opportunities. New Mexico professionals join us in the classroom and help design our projects. These vital connections support our students and offer opportunities to give back to the place we all call home.",0,,0,,,,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,Justin Trager,Executive Director,Justin@ACELeadership.org

In a state that consistently ranks near the bottom of most education inventories, the school’s high achievement results over time have drawn notice. Located in rural northern New Mexico, Taos Academy serves a high-poverty area; its student body is 50% economically disadvantaged and is primarily made up of underserved populations. The county’s rate of teen suicide, binge drinking, and children affected by poverty are also all higher than the state averages. Flexible weekly scheduling, individualized curriculum, and emphasis on 21st century learning skills are some of the ways that this small charter school is personalizing education for their students and families.",0,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,Elizabeth LeBlanc,Principal/Head of School,eleblanc@taosacademy.org

Personalized Instruction: Scholars receive individualized instruction designed to support, encourage, challenge, and motivate them. Students take ownership over their learning, and their daily experience adjusts based on their unique skills, interests, and academic goals.  3. Project Based Learning: Our schools use true-to-life projects to help build students’ leadership skills and innovative-thinking skills. Our project-based learning curriculum is designed to be affirming of students’ identities, directly relevant to their lives, and culturally responsive. In each project, scholars work collaboratively with their peers and actively engage within and around their communities.  4.

This vision was implemented in the fall of 2014 with the opening of DB-EXCEL (Excellence in a Creative Environment for Learning).  From its initial stages, the program included an intentional focus on professional learning and a continuous process of reflective evaluation.

We are growing these seeds into an integrated, responsive, student-centered, community-rooted model of urban public secondary education.  What if all 9th and 10th graders experienced a rich set of interdisciplinary, community-based learning experiences, culminating in performances and products for real audiences? What if our students’ 9th and 10th grade experiences were built to help them navigate and succeed in learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom, preparing them for more independent work in junior and senior years?   In 9th grade, as students are first finding Common Ground, their experiences starts close to home -- focused on their own identity, our 20-acre campus, and their place in our community.  The year starts with an immersion in Common Ground’s urban farm, and in questions related to this place -- how we feed ourselves and meet our other basic needs, how we build a food system is fair and just, how energy flows through our food system, what math tells us about what Common Ground’s urban farm should grow. Students move from this focus on basic needs to a study of how to survive and thrive in a diverse community, and then  explore how we create positive change in the places we call home. Each unit culminates in a real performance for a public audience: presenting a variety of work at a family food night, for instance. Through these experiences, students make measurable and significant growth as readers, writers, and problem-solvers -- and gain the skills they need to navigate and advocate in a variety of learning settings. Because a team of teachers share these new students and the curriculum is built to help students share their experiences, teachers can be responsive to the young people in front of them.   In 10th grade, students turn from their own campus and identity to the City of New Haven as a whole.  Four integrated units -- New Haven Stories, Justice & Change, Climate & Power, and Community Health -- push students to explore the systems and dynamics that have shaped our city, and how they can help to create a more just and sustainable community. Student venture out into the city throughout each unit -- connecting with neighborhood leaders, exploring neighborhood change, helping policymakers develop solutions to real problems -- and community members regularly push in to roles as co-teachers. Again, each unit challenges students to synthesize and share their learning for an authentic audience: building a website and photo essay about their New Haven stories, producing an original piece of theater that enacts and intervenes in injustice, creating public art that helps address climate change, producing video public service announcements that help create a healthier community. The expectations of students ramp up, as they prepare to take greater control of their educational path in grades 11 and 12.   These experiences will be grounded in a common set of design principles, co-created by Common Ground students and teachers -- the foundational building blocks of teaching and learning at Common Ground. Through extended units of study, students will tackle questions and problems that hit close to home – relevant and responsive to their own lives, and the communities and cultures they call home. These interdisciplinary units will integrate core disciplinary standards and teachers from math, science, ELA, and social studies into a deep learning experience that takes up half of students’ school day. Through start-of-unit expeditions, ongoing field work, and culminating performances for public audiences, students will experience and develop skills for navigating a larger learning ecosystem. These experiences will also be designed to build students’ capacity as leaders, change agents, and social justice advocates – rooted in Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework.  Students will have real and growing voice and agency about what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate learning – and universal design will support the participation of all students.   What if all juniors and seniors were able to curate their own learning plan, with support from their academic advisors, integrating college courses, work experiences, internships, elective courses, and core academic offerings?   As students move into their last two years of high school, they will take increasing control of their own education. A core junior seminar will ground their experience, in which they will build skills for action research, explore college and career options, and identify expanded learning opportunities that match their interests. The following year, a Senior Environmental Justice Capstone will support students as they refine college essays, conduct college-level research on social and environmental challenges, take on capstone projects that address these challenges, and prepare to defend their leadership portfolios.    We know, as well, that core academic classes will form a key part of every student’s schedule, and that these courses will include opportunities for community-based field work, culminating performances for public audiences, and learning that is tied to college, career, and community leadership. We are fully committed to a vertically aligned, scaffolded experience in the core subjects that ensures that all students graduate college-ready.   In the context of these anchor experiences, the junior and senior experience will consistently blur the line between school and the larger community, between school day and out-of-school time. All of our juniors and seniors will participate in a combination of early college courses, work-based learning opportunities, internships, and credit-bearing out-of-school opportunities. Many will travel to Southern Connecticut State University, just around the corner from Common Ground’s campus, for a part of their school day. Community organizations will push into the school day and building in more robust ways, as well; for instance, the education director from a local theater company teaches a course on using devised theater methodologies to confront social justice challenges. Students will earn credit by documenting learning in out-of-school programs, work placements, and internships.  Some students will develop their own learning experiences from the ground up.  The mix of these types of experiences vary from student to student. Some will opt for more traditional high school experiences, while others will participate more in the wider learning ecosystem.    What if experiences through Green Jobs Corps, Common Ground’s urban farm and community programs, and out-of-school opportunities were intentionally connected with academic classes, so that students had a chance to practice skills and understandings developed in their courses in the workplace and other out-of-school settings? What if all students built and explored their own pathways through their four years of high school, integrating experiences in a wide range of learning environments?     Some students will choose to blaze their own pathways, while others will find one that’s well trodden already. The farm immersion unit in the 9th grade core prepares students for a community-based exploration of food justice and access in the 10th grade core. Students can choose to dive deeper into these questions through an elective course on food justice, perhaps leading into a farm internship, a paid work opportunity through our Green Jobs Corps, farm-based after-school programs, and/or a senior project.  Students will explore pathways to college, as well. Every 9th grader makes it onto the campus of Southern Connecticut State University  -- touring campus, participating in workshops led by undergraduates, and accessing campus resources. As sophomores, they will collaborate with Southern’s public health department to take on community-based health research, and work with a theater company housed at Southern to create Theater of the Oppressed-style productions. They will be able to take a course on Common Ground’s campus, taught by Southern faculty and bearing college credit. They can also choose to take courses for free at SCSU -- and are more likely to experience success because of the supports that are in place.   What if students’ leadership portfolio and school-wide leadership framework were tools for documenting mastery and growth in non-academic and academic competencies, across all of these experiences and settings? What if our students’ academic advisors worked with students and their families to create and leverage the mix of learning opportunities that were right for them?      When students participate in a program at the Peabody Museum, or an internship in our Nature Year program, they and the staff who supervise them will document their learning goals and outcomes using Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework – earning credit by demonstrating growth and mastery of transferable skills. Working with Common Ground’s art teacher, they will demonstrate how these out-of-school experiences demonstrate mastery of subject area standards, as well – allowing them to earn advanced art credit toward graduation.  Similarly, the grades and feedback that students receive in their Common Ground courses will reflect both students’ growth in transferable leadership skills, and their mastery of academic standards.   Students’ advisors will help students identify and dive into experiences that match their interests, and will coordinate with the staff responsible for overseeing expanded learning to ensure that a clear learning plan is in place. Over four years of high school, students’ work in advisory will have scaffolded deep growth in non-academic domains: supporting social/emotional development, increased agency and leadership capacity, college and career exploration, and the goal-setting and follow-through skills needed to take control of their educational experience. By the time they graduate, students will have built and defended a rich electronic portfolio that integrates academic learning and leadership competencies. It will be the norm to share these portfolios with college admissions offices and prospective employers. Students’ transcripts will also reflect growth and mastery through this rich engagement with the wider learning ecosystem.  What if -- through these experiences and the flexible pathways that connect them -- every Common Ground student graduated ready for college success (recognizing that some students will choose to pursue other paths), powerful environmental justice leadership, meaningful careers, and healthy, happy, whole, sustainable lives? That is our ultimate vision: That students choose their own path AND meet universally high expectations for growth and competence.",1,"Here is a link to a presentation that share's Common Ground's core frameworks, including our Portrait of a graduate: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c6Q_DsnQSm_goevyXOcL2m_aNl4hpNHOZQE3l_jhOTM/edit?usp=sharing",0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Joel Tolman,Director of Community Impact & Engagement,jtolman@commongroundct.org

I am so used to having to fight and argue for the bare minimum to keep him engaged. The fact that Will is advocating for himself with this team and making sure he is getting his assignments done is a complete 360 for him. He actually has been encouraging me to spend time and read a book that they are studying in ELA -- he hated ELA and wouldn't even write when prompted. Your team is reaching my son!
