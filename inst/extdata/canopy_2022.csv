The school was primed to achieve the same status the following year, but was interrupted by the pandemic.

The CLK Engage program is designed to create a learning environment where teachers are shared.  Students and staff begin their day by having all three classes come together for “Morning Meeting.”  Inspirational quotes and character lessons are incorporated in the “Morning Meeting” to inspire, motivate and teach positive behavior expectations before launching the students into their language arts groups.  After lunch and recess, the students are also launched into their math groups.  At the end of the day, all of the students and staff come together again to celebrate good things for what they call “launch.”  “Morning Meeting” and “Launch” provide opportunities for all students to come together to build positive relationships with all three teachers.

CLK Engage has also implemented “Fun Fridays.”  At the end of the day on Friday, students have the opportunity to choose the classroom they would like to spend their time based on the activity the teacher is offering.

We are growing these seeds into an integrated, responsive, student-centered, community-rooted model of urban public secondary education.

What if all 9th and 10th graders experienced a rich set of interdisciplinary, community-based learning experiences, culminating in performances and products for real audiences? What if our students’ 9th and 10th grade experiences were built to help them navigate and succeed in learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom, preparing them for more independent work in junior and senior years? 

In 9th grade, as students are first finding Common Ground, their experiences starts close to home -- focused on their own identity, our 20-acre campus, and their place in our community.  The year starts with an immersion in Common Ground’s urban farm, and in questions related to this place -- how we feed ourselves and meet our other basic needs, how we build a food system is fair and just, how energy flows through our food system, what math tells us about what Common Ground’s urban farm should grow. Students move from this focus on basic needs to a study of how to survive and thrive in a diverse community, and then  explore how we create positive change in the places we call home. Each unit culminates in a real performance for a public audience: presenting a variety of work at a family food night, for instance. Through these experiences, students make measurable and significant growth as readers, writers, and problem-solvers -- and gain the skills they need to navigate and advocate in a variety of learning settings. Because a team of teachers share these new students and the curriculum is built to help students share their experiences, teachers can be responsive to the young people in front of them. 

In 10th grade, students turn from their own campus and identity to the City of New Haven as a whole.  Four integrated units -- New Haven Stories, Justice & Change, Climate & Power, and Community Health -- push students to explore the systems and dynamics that have shaped our city, and how they can help to create a more just and sustainable community. Student venture out into the city throughout each unit -- connecting with neighborhood leaders, exploring neighborhood change, helping policymakers develop solutions to real problems -- and community members regularly push in to roles as co-teachers. Again, each unit challenges students to synthesize and share their learning for an authentic audience: building a website and photo essay about their New Haven stories, producing an original piece of theater that enacts and intervenes in injustice, creating art that helps address climate change, producing video public service announcements that help create a healthier community. The expectations of students ramp up, as they prepare to take greater control of their educational path in grades 11 and 12. 

These experiences will be grounded in a common set of design principles, co-created by Common Ground students and teachers -- the foundational building blocks of teaching and learning at Common Ground. Through extended units of study, students will tackle questions and problems that hit close to home – relevant and responsive to their own lives, and the communities and cultures they call home. These interdisciplinary units will integrate core disciplinary standards and teachers from math, science, ELA, and social studies into a deep learning experience that takes up half of students’ school day. Through start-of-unit expeditions, ongoing field work, and culminating performances for public audiences, students will experience and develop skills for navigating a larger learning ecosystem. These experiences will also be designed to build students’ capacity as leaders, change agents, and social justice advocates – rooted in Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework.  Students will have real and growing voice and agency about what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate learning – and universal design will support the participation of all students. 

What if all juniors and seniors were able to curate their own learning plan, with support from their academic advisors, integrating college courses, work experiences, internships, elective courses, and core academic offerings? 

As students move into their last two years of high school, they will take increasing control of their own education. A core junior seminar will ground their experience, in which they will build skills for action research, explore college and career options, and identify expanded learning opportunities that match their interests. The following year, a Senior Environmental Justice Capstone will support students as they refine college essays, conduct college-level research on social and environmental challenges, take on capstone projects that address these challenges, and prepare to defend their leadership portfolios.  

We know, as well, that core academic classes will form a key part of every student’s schedule, and that these courses will include opportunities for community-based field work, culminating performances for public audiences, and learning that is tied to college, career, and community leadership. We are fully committed to a vertically aligned, scaffolded experience in the core subjects that ensures that all students graduate college-ready. 

In the context of these anchor experiences, the junior and senior experience will consistently blur the line between school and the larger community, between school day and out-of-school time. All of our juniors and seniors will participate in a combination of early college courses, work-based learning opportunities, internships, and credit-bearing out-of-school opportunities. Many will travel to Southern Connecticut State University, just around the corner from Common Ground’s campus, for a part of their school day. Community organizations will push into the school day and building in more robust ways, as well; for instance, the education director from a local theater company teaches a course on using devised theater methodologies to confront social justice challenges. Students will earn credit by documenting learning in out-of-school programs, work placements, and internships.  Some students will develop their own learning experiences from the ground up.

The mix of these types of experiences vary from student to student. Some will opt for more traditional high school experiences, while others will participate more in the wider learning ecosystem.  

What if experiences through Green Jobs Corps, Common Ground’s urban farm and community programs, and out-of-school opportunities were intentionally connected with academic classes, so that students had a chance to practice skills and understandings developed in their courses in the workplace and other out-of-school settings? What if all students built and explored their own pathways through their four years of high school, integrating experiences in a wide range of learning environments?   

Some students will choose to blaze their own pathways, while others will find one that’s well trodden already. The farm immersion unit in the 9th grade core prepares students for a community-based exploration of food justice and access in the 10th grade core. Students can choose to dive deeper into these questions through an elective course on food justice, perhaps leading into a farm internship, a paid work opportunity through our Green Jobs Corps, farm-based after-school programs, and/or a senior project.

Students will explore pathways to college, as well. Every 9th grader makes it onto the campus of Southern Connecticut State University  -- touring campus, participating in workshops led by undergraduates, and accessing campus resources. As sophomores, they will collaborate with Southern’s public health department to take on community-based health research, and work with a theater company housed at Southern to create Theater of the Oppressed-style productions. They will be able to take a course on Common Ground’s campus, taught by Southern faculty and bearing college credit. They can also choose to take courses for free at SCSU -- and are more likely to experience success because of the supports that are in place. 

What if students’ leadership portfolio and school-wide leadership framework were tools for documenting mastery and growth in non-academic and academic competencies, across all of these experiences and settings? What if our students’ academic advisors worked with students and their families to create and leverage the mix of learning opportunities that were right for them?    

When students participate in a program at the Peabody Museum, or an internship in our Nature Year program, they and the staff who supervise them will document their learning goals and outcomes using Common Ground’s school-wide leadership framework – earning credit by demonstrating growth and mastery of transferable skills. Working with Common Ground’s art teacher, they will demonstrate how these out-of-school experiences demonstrate mastery of subject area standards, as well – allowing them to earn advanced art credit toward graduation.  Similarly, the grades and feedback that students receive in their Common Ground courses will reflect both students’ growth in transferable leadership skills, and their mastery of academic standards. 

Students’ advisors will help students identify and dive into experiences that match their interests, and will coordinate with the staff responsible for overseeing expanded learning to ensure that a clear learning plan is in place. Over four years of high school, students’ work in advisory will have scaffolded deep growth in non-academic domains: supporting social/emotional development, increased agency and leadership capacity, college and career exploration, and the goal-setting and follow-through skills needed to take control of their educational experience. By the time they graduate, students will have built and defended a rich electronic portfolio that integrates academic learning and leadership competencies. It will be the norm to share these portfolios with college admissions offices and prospective employers. Students’ transcripts will also reflect growth and mastery through this rich engagement with the wider learning ecosystem.

What if -- through these experiences and the flexible pathways that connect them -- every Common Ground student graduated ready for college success (recognizing that some students will choose to pursue other paths), powerful environmental justice leadership, meaningful careers, and healthy, happy, whole, sustainable lives? That is our ultimate vision: That students choose their own path AND meet universally high expectations for growth and competence.",6,5,1,2,8,4,3,,7,,Unequal Expectations & Opportunities → High Expectations with Unlimited Opportunities,Narrow Focus → Whole-Child Focus,Rote Activities →  Rigorous Learning,Irrelevance → Relevance,Assimilation & Marginalization → Affirmation of Self & Others,Reinforcement of the Status Quo → Social Consciousness & Action,Isolation → Connection & Community,,Passive Compliance → Active Self-Direction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90001400807,Urban,222,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,36.21%,0.00%,0.00%,38.36%,0.00%,22.41%,3.02%,63.51%,17.82%,3.47%,,,"Making the Road by Walking, from Green Schools Catalyst Quarterly",https://catalyst.greenschoolsnationalnetwork.org/gscatalyst/june_2019/MobilePagedReplica.action?pm=2&folio=86#pg86,"Profiles of Innovation: Common Ground High School, from CRPE",https://crpe.org/new-england-profiles-of-innovation-common-ground-high-school/,Common Ground: Our Approach to Learning,https://www.commongroundct.org/high-school/environmental-learning/,Joel Tolman,Director of Community Impact & Engagement,jtolman@commongroundct.org,,2022-03-08 9:43:56

Let’s start with a story.

“How can we reduce the environmental and social impact of our shops?” The managers of Pinwheel Coffee and Framework Cycles asked this to Embark students early in the school year. And, they spent the next two months answering it. Students started with an environmental audit of the shops. They identified issues like plastic and paper use, rubber and metal waste, production of coffee, tea, and milk, and materials that bikes and components are made of, among other things. 

In many places, the learning would stop there but at Embark we strive to go deeper. Guided by the educators, students explored their chosen issue. In science, they tackled topics such as properties of matter, chemical change, and erosion. In social studies, they identified countries where key products are grown, mined, or produced. They researched government structures and policies related to their issue to understand the impact.

What really sets Embark apart is that the learning and work has real meaning and impact.  Students used their research to create formal presentations to the shop managers. Once accepted, students got to actually implement their recommendations in the shops. Students wrote the text and designed posters to inform Pinwheel patrons about why almond milk now costs extra. They worked with bike manufacturers to stock new more sustainable brands at Framework. They worked with the local government and nonprofits to create a rubber recycling program for used bike tubes. In short, they made real change happen.",6,1,2,4,,9,5,7,3,8,Unequal Expectations & Opportunities → High Expectations with Unlimited Opportunities,Narrow Focus → Whole-Child Focus,Rote Activities →  Rigorous Learning,Irrelevance → Relevance,,Reinforcement of the Status Quo → Social Consciousness & Action,Isolation → Connection & Community,Inflexible Systems → Customization,Passive Compliance → Active Self-Direction,"Siloed Schooling → Anytime, Anywhere Learning",,1,,32,,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,15,5,20,,5,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A Revolution in Education- Podcast,https://www.arevolutionineducation.org/season2/episode14,"Embark Education: Rethinking Middle School Through Embedded, Integrated, and Learner-Centered Education",https://learnercentered.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Embark-Education-Partner-Case-Study.pdf,A Call for Learner-Centered Leaders to See Each Other Inside the Same Movement,https://education-reimagined.org/a-call-for-learner-centered-leaders-to-see-each-other-inside-the-same-movement/,Brian Hyosaka,Head of School,brianh@embarkeducation.org,,2022-02-23 16:39:00

Modern learners have the chance to create and forge meaningful learning experiences and connect with the world around them.

We recognize that the emergence of technology provides boundless access to information and opportunities to create, design, and invent. Technology also connects learners on a local and global level, to foster communication, collaboration, and creativity. Students now, more than ever, are equipped with the tools to innovate, to reimagine their education, and to serve as pioneers in both existing and new fields. 

Preparing students for an unpredictable future requires a variety of knowledge, skills, and dispositions.
-As global citizens, students must be able to demonstrate an understanding of others’ needs and understand the value of a diversity of experiences, cultures, and perspectives.
-As solution seekers they need to be able to recognize obstacles, diagnose the issues that limit progress, apply strategies to address their concerns, and reflect on the effectiveness of their response.
-As skillful collaborators, students to work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams in a variety of formats.
-As inspired innovators, they need to be able to elaborate, refine, analyze, evaluate, and iterate their ideas in order to maximize their creative efforts.
-As mindful learners, they need to be able to regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors as they persist toward personal and learning goals.
-As effective communicators, they must articulate and listen with attention to knowledge, values, attitudes, and intentions.

Although we recognize the changing realities of the modern world, there are current aspects of our professional work that remain important for the future of Nipmuc. We must continue to provide students with opportunities to be introduced to key content and knowledge needed to ignite their passions, broaden their understanding, and develop cultural literacy. We also recognize that we need to continue to prepare our students to achieve in traditional forms of assessment that are valued by colleges and employers.

​Because traditional achievement is only one measure of success, we must expand our definition to include moments of reflection, resilience, creativity, collaboration, experimentation, and inspiration. 

As our world evolves, our professional practices must reflect and include opportunities to collaborate, reflect, innovate, and initiate.  Students should be encouraged to seek novel approaches to learning. As educators, we must continually reflect, review, and revise our professional work to make sure our work supports our definition of learning, beliefs about learning, and the vision of our graduates.",,,3,2,,,,4,1,,,,Rote Activities →  Rigorous Learning,Irrelevance → Relevance,,,,Inflexible Systems → Customization,Passive Compliance → Active Self-Direction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,250768001202,Rural,641,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,1.26%,0.00%,2.20%,4.41%,0.31%,89.29%,2.52%,,20.50%,0.16%,,,"""Stretching the Concept of What's Possible"" - Article featured in AASA",https://my.aasa.org/AASA/Resources/SAMag/2019/Oct19/Quinn.aspx,"""The power of student exhibitions"" - Article published on GreatSchools.org",https://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/the-power-of-student-exhibitions/,Press Release about Nipmuc's Participation in the Kaleidoscope Collective,https://bit.ly/NipmucKaleidoscope,John Clements & Mary Anne Moran,Co-Principals,nipmucprincipals@mursd.org,,2022-03-13 8:19:22

Our strong vision is rooted in our core belief that each unique learner at St. John Paul II has gifts to celebrate and that every child can achieve at high levels.

In partnership with the University of Notre Dame, we use blended learning, which combines targeted, personalized online lessons, small-group learning, and classroom instruction to fill the gaps in each scholar’s knowledge.

At the same time, our teachers employ instructional methods that help every scholar successfully work with rigorous grade-level material.  This ensures that each child, at every academic level, will experience growth with the goal of reaching grade level proficiency.

Our scholars take ownership of their education and collaborate with teachers to create individual learning plans that identify their goals for academic growth and incorporate parent participation.

We continually measure scholar growth, which allows us to determine the specific areas in which a scholar needs more care and attention.

We partner with families to prepare each scholar for high school success, with expectations that they will graduate and seek higher education.
