The Avalon teacher team chooses to use a self-directed project-based learning program and 360-degree teacher evaluation. They have have very low teacher turnover rates (5.3%). They also take seriously the notion of educating the whole child, and along with traditional assessments use the Hope Survey to assess students' non-academic outcomes, such as self-efficacy, optimism, and problem-solving ability, so the teacher team can evaluate what areas of school design the team needs to adjust in order to better help its students improve these outcomes.  The teacher team believes it is important to model collaborative leadership to their students and therefore decided to make the student body a voting branch of the school government, with students passing bills (for example, on acceptable cell phone and school attendance policies).

Notwithstanding Booneville's significant challenges, the blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.  As the model expands and continues to improve, the program will help to develop and prepare a pipeline of talented, high-achieving students from Mississippi's most rural and impoverished districts for post-secondary success.",College preparatory,We have a traditional and blended model of education for our students.

This is a school for at-promise youth in NYC. The model is competency-based, blended-learning, highly personalized, and a highly unusual school design. Their students enter the school overage and under-credited, and despite this, 80+% of the graduating class enrolls in college, and of this group, 80% of students persist beyond the freshman year. 

Bronx Arena High School is a transfer school serving over-age, under-credited students. The school is a collaboration between the Department of Education and SCO Family Services, a social service agency that provides social and emotional support, as well as college counseling. Students are paired with ""advocate counselors"" from SCO Family Services. Students work through a web-based mastery system at their own pace, and receive 1:1 and small-group support from teachers in flexible ""arena"" blocks. Each arena has a generalist teacher and an advocate counselor, both of whom support students academically and personally throughout the day. Students also work with content specialists, who push in during the day to provide additional one-on-one or small group instruction in particular areas. Generalists and content specialists collaborate closely and analyze data to ensure all students are receiving the supports they need to be successful. The school combines online learning with face-to-face instruction in a method pioneered by Principal Ty Cesene at an alternative school in El Segundo, California. Bronx Arena develops its curriculum materials in-house, through a rigorous faculty review process. Technology components, specifically a custom-built data system accessible to students and staff at all times, create a personalized experience where students work at their own pace, mastering the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. Students track their own productivity and work toward completing five learning tasks per day. To receive credit for a course, students must demonstrate mastery by completing two challenges and a capstone project. Students complete senior portfolios on a topic of their choice that represents a culmination of their learning.","Mission: Bronx Arena High School's mission is to support and empower over-age, under-credited students to achieve academic success so they can earn a high school diploma and graduate prepared to enter college, post-secondary training, or a career path that matches their personal and professional goals and aspirations. Bronx Arena's graduates will be self-motivated and confident allowing them to expand and express their own talents.  Vision: Bronx Arena High School is a collaboration between the New York City Department of Education, and SCO Family of Service. As partners, we understand the interdependent relationship between personalized learning communities and academic achievement, viewing both as essential to enabling all students to meet high standards and create productive futures for themselves. Individualizing, personalizing, and humanizing education, are the surest ways to academic engagement and success.  Our school is based on the belief that high quality student-teacher relationships coupled with student-centered learning and personalized educational experiences are the essential components of a successful 21st century educational community. A school that focuses on one of the essential components without building capacity in the other two risks alienating a portion of the student population.  We maintain that high quality instruction and learning are not substitutes for quality relationships between school staff and students. School staff must come to the table with effective, interpersonal, facilitation and group processing skills to develop positive supportive relationships with each student. Once a caring, supportive school culture is established, staff are able to build a high functioning, high performing group of learners. ","What is The Arena Model?  The Arena Model is an instructional model used by Bronx Arena High School in which, over the course of the school year, a single generalist teacher works with and teaches one group of approximately 25 students.  During the school day, the teacher is in the classroom teaching lessons, facilitating discussions, tracking students' progress and having one-on-one meetings with this set group of students. All the generalist teachers have their own areas of expertise. For example, a the generalist teacher may be a licensed ELA teacher or may be a licensed Science teacher. In the Bronx Arena blended classroom, the generalist teachers guide the students through the subject area in which they are licensed and also guide the students through other blended courses. Students' experiences in courses outside the teachers' license areas are based on Bronx Arena's fully developed, common core aligned subject specific curriculum. Content specialty teachers also provide push-in and pull-out services for the students. For example, if the generalist teacher is licensed in ELA, a Math teacher will come in at scheduled times to teach students focused math mini-lesson and will pull specific students out of class to provide focused math support. With a case load of approximately 25 students, a generalist teacher is able to get to know each student's skills, interests and academic needs at a much deeper and more comprehensive level than they would be able to in a traditional schedule. In a traditional schedule, a teacher may have up to five different classes with up to 34 students in each class. In any semester, a teacher with this schedule may have 130-150 students. With a caseload of this size, a teacher's ability to know each individual student's skills, interests and academic needs are severely limited.  In The Arena Model, teachers have a manageable caseload that allows them to plan and differentiate in ways that truly serve each individual student. The Arena Model classroom is, in a fundamental way, different from a traditional classroom.  In a traditional classroom, a group of students are working in the same room on the same course at the same time. In the Arena Model classroom, one student can be working on an ELA course, the next student over can be working on Math, the next student can be working on Science and the next student can be working on a different Science course. Though this may sound like a lot to be going on in one room at one time, in the Arena Model approach this fully planned, organized and managed.  Planning and Organizing the Arena Model Classroom  The first step for the Arena Model teacher is to learn about each student's academic needs, skills and interests.  The teacher does this in several ways, including reading the student's transcripts and permanent records, having one on one conversations with the student and the student's family, and giving the student baseline assessments. Once the Arena Model teacher has a good sense of the student's academic needs, skills and interests, the teacher can then work with the student to identify the appropriate courses for the student and the plan for the student to complete these courses. The teacher and student will choose courses that are at the correct academic level and that the student is interested in taking. For example, there may be several different Social Studies courses available that are at the right academic level and that have different themes. The student can choose the course with the theme that seems to be the most interesting and engaging. In addition to identifying the most appropriate courses, the teacher and student will also make a schedule that will work for the individual student. In a traditional schedule, a student will take 5-7 courses in a semester. In this traditional model, over a set period of time, the student will simultaneously be focusing on 5-7 distinct subject areas. This approach may work for some students, but it doesn't work for all students.  In the Arena Model classroom, a student may choose to focus intensely on 2-3 courses at once over a shorter period of time. Then, once each course is completed, the student can take on an additional course. With the Arena Model, a student can complete the same number of courses in the same amount of time as in a traditional schedule.  If a student is moving at a faster pace, the student can actually complete more courses in a given time than in a traditional schedule.  The difference with the Arena Model is that both the number of courses a student is focusing on at any given time, and the amount of time that student has to complete a course, is not dictated by a pre-set schedule.  In the Arena Model, the number of classes a student takes and completes is dictated by the student's progress. Having larger blocks of time with students has many other advantages as well. It allows students to focus on work at whatever pace is best suited to his or her own style. In most school schedules, a student may start a task or assignment and, regardless of where the student is in completing the task or assignment, when the bell rings it is time for the student to get up and move to the next class. In the Arena Model, a student can take whatever focused time he or she needs to complete an assignment. In the Arena Model, if a group is working together on a project, they will have larger blocks of time to focus on their collaboration. And in the Arena Model, teachers have a lot of freedom to schedule personalized interventions and discussions with every student. In more traditional schedules, many teachers find that when they try to meet with students one on one, other students complain that the teachers never get to them. In the Arena Model, because teachers have the students for so much time, there is time for everything. The teacher can meet one on one with students, knowing that they have enough time to meet with each student. Each student is secure in knowing that the teacher has enough time to get everyone. 

How Does One Teacher Teach Multiple Subject Areas?  Each generalist teacher has his or her own area of expertise. One generalist teacher may be a licensed ELA teacher. Another generalist teacher may by a Science teacher and another may be a Math teacher. The generalist teacher is, of course, fully trained in and capable of teaching within his or her own subject area. Many people wonder, though, how a generalist teacher can teach other classes outside of his or her subject area. There are several ways that the Bronx Arena High School blended instructional approach makes the Arena Model approach possible. First, within each subject area, there is fully developed, Common Core aligned, on-line curriculum. The generalist teacher's job is not to write curriculum for all of the courses that the students in the room are taking.  The curriculum is already written and available to all of the students.  The generalist teacher's job is to support each student through the courses that meet their needs. (See the Bronx Arena ""Blended Instruction Teacher's Manual"" for a detailed explanation of how teachers facilitate students' progress through blended curriculum.) One of the most powerful tools available to the Arena Model teacher is to support a student in an area outside of the teacher's expertise. Most of the time, the teacher is the expert in the room. When the teacher is supporting the student in an area outside of the teacher's expertise, instead of being the expert, the teacher is now a co-learner with the student. As a co-learner, the teacher can model and demonstrate for the student how one learns. Instead of ""teaching"" the student, the teacher is now collaborating with the student. This experience can provide the student with not just an understanding of the material at hand, but, through working with the teacher in this way, it can also help the student see and understand how to approach and learn new material. In addition to co-learning new material with the teacher, the students in the Arena Model classroom are also supported by other subject area teachers. This occurs in several different ways. First, the generalist teacher and a subject area teacher may do regularly scheduled team teaching.  For example, a generalist teacher who specializes in ELA may co-plan and co-teach with a Math teacher who comes into the room at regularly scheduled times. The two teachers can teach focused mini-lessons at set points in the curriculum. Instead of team teaching, a subject area teacher can do scheduled push-in sessions, in which the subject area teacher comes into the class and independently teaches mini-lessons or provides focused supports to specific students. And finally, subject area teachers can do pull-outs in which specific students are pulled out of class for specific lessons or supports. For example, a Science teacher may pull students out of the Arena class to complete certain labs. In traditional classes, students get to experience teachers who are experts in their subject areas. Obviously, there are many advantages to this model. With the teacher as expert, the student gets to experience all of the teacher's knowledge, passion and expertise on the subject. In the Arena classroom, none of this is lost. Students participating in The Arena Model will still have teachers who are experts in their subject area. It may not be every day for every task, but it will be regular, consistent and whenever necessary. In addition to experiencing the teacher as expert, the Arena student will also experience the teacher as co-learner. Through this experience, students learn how to approach, make sense of and break down a problem. Students learn how to learn. 

Building Community in the Arena Classroom: One of the biggest advantages to the Arena approach is the sense of community that it creates for the students. Students in high school often feel isolated. When students feel isolated, it is easy for them to become disengaged in school. And one of the biggest concerns for the blended classroom is that students will come into the room and primarily interact with their computer, as opposed to interacting with the teacher and with each other. Through the Bronx Arena Facilitation Modes, Bronx Arena has structures to ensure that students are involved in class beyond simply interacting with their computers but, even so, creating that all important sense of a classroom community can still be a struggle. Fundamental to the Arena classroom is developing a sense of community among the students. In the Arena classroom, 25 students are together every day for the majority of the school day. Within this structure, there is an opportunity for the teachers and students to develop relationships that are much deeper than what can be developed during the traditional 40 minute class period. Building these relationships is one of driving principals behind the Arena Model. It is essential that, starting with the very first day of class, the Arena Model teacher structure activities, discussions and lessons that build the classroom community. These activities should include introductory games, ice breakers and group discussions. Because the teacher does not have one set curriculum that must be followed at all times for all students, the teacher can make sure to regularly include opportunities for the students to interact with each other in positive ways. Throughout the school year, the teacher must ensure that these types of activities continue. The more that the teacher develops a class culture and community, the more the students will engage in school and in their classes.   

Tracking Student Needs and Progress: In the Arena Model, because the teacher has only 25 students, the teacher is able to track each student's needs and progress in far greater detail than would be possible if the teacher had 100 or more students. The generalist teacher is able to see and understand where each student is doing well and where each student needs further support. In traditional schools, different teachers have discrete pieces of information about a student. These teachers may have difficulties setting up a meeting to get a more global understanding of the student's progress and struggles. In many instances, teachers may not even realize that other teachers have different information and that a meeting about the student is necessary. In the Arena Model, if a student is starting to fall behind, the teacher has a global view on what is happening. The teacher has a true sense of where the student is successful, where the student is struggling, and what steps need to be taken to support the student to be successful.  In traditional classes, students experience a wide variety of teachers that teach multiple skills in different ways. In the Arena Model, the teacher is able to identify focus areas that the specific student needs to further develop. The teacher can then ensure that these focus skills are applied consistently in all of the student's courses. For example, if a student needs to work on a particular skill, such as writing paragraphs, the generalist teacher can teach paragraph-writing and ensure that the student applies this skill in a consistent way in all of his her courses. Across disciplines, the generalist teacher can make sure that the student is learning the skills in a uniform manner that meet the needs of that particular student.

They are working with a challenging urban school population (K-8), and have put into place a deeply personalized approach that builds on knowing each child deeply and enabling increasing degrees of agency among the students, helping them develop a broad set of competencies. They are very articulate on how they have worked with the staff to co-develop this model, across three cohorts of teachers. Colleen Collins gave us an important lesson from her work there as principal: ""everyone needs to feel that they're part of the pilot."" Meaning: initially the school worked deeply with its first cohort to co-develop the model, and then did the same with the second cohort; when it came time to bring the third cohort into the work, those teachers were told to watch the other cohorts and ""do what they do."" That strategy produced some pushback from those teachers and convinced Colleen and other school leaders that in fact, it is crucial in designing and implementing agency-driven learning models to make sure that the adults are all experiencing the same kind of agency-driven culture. Later cohorts of teachers can't simply be asked to implement; they must be invited to co-create as much as earlier cohorts, even as they also are able to build on the work of those cohorts. This is a crucial lesson for the field. The change processes and the professional culture of teachers must mirror the 21st-century goals and learning strategies that we are all holding for students.","The Mission of CICS West Belden, in partnership with families and the community, is to motivate, challenge, and empower today's students through personalized innovation and choice so that they will achieve success tomorrow.","We believe that culture is king, and that we have a shared responsibility to make sure our school is the most positive place to teach and learn each day.

Today we strive to identify each student's educational target zone and meet them where they are to advance them to the highest possible achievement levels for them. A culture around data has been developed and is emphasized with both students and teachers. Additionally we strive to give the students choice in learning and to engage them in a way that fosters their educational ownership. ","Cisco Elementary has moved from an ultra-traditional model (desks in a row, teacher on stage, instruct-test-repeat) to a place for anyone interested in blended and personalized learning can come to see dynamic instruction. We identified grounding pillars for our program and then allowed teachers the autonomy to create classrooms to fit their specific need. Walking our halls you will see flipped models, individual pathways, station rotation, and lab rotation classrooms all under on roof; however, all are guided by data, provide student's agency, personalize, and focus on increasing rigor for each student. While doing all of this, we maintain a traditional approach to some school structures: PE, music, recess, start/end times, grading, etc. We believe blended learning at Cisco means taking the best of traditional education, i.e. great teachers who are passionate about what they do, and combining it with the best of today's technology, which we feel is hardware/software that enables teachers to personalize and to attend to each student as a individual.

37,106,Confirmed,Citizens of the World Hollywood,Los Angeles,California,Citizens of the World,No,Charter School Growth Fund,"CWC offers a compelling academic and character development model that has produced high academic outcomes for their students. Diversity of their students is at the center of their student culture and academic model design, and CWC is one of the few networks their size that has a director of DEI focusing on this work full-time. This model allows students to form meaningful relationships with students from other races, cultures, and backgrounds. CWC has developed graduate dispositions that are integrated in their academic instructions to help students become aware of their identity and develop their social and emotional skills. ","Citizens of the World Los Angeles (CWC LA) is a non-profit organization that operates three diverse, academically rigorous public charter schools, all founded collaboratively by parents, educators and community members: CWC Hollywood, founded in 2010 and serving TK-5th grade; CWC Silver Lake, founded in 2012 and serving TK-8th grade; and CWC Mar Vista, serving TK-7th grade in 2018-19 and expanding to 8th grade next year.  We aim to create an intimate network of high-achieving, joyful, community-based public schools that reflect the abundant racial, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity of their surrounding neighborhoods. Our purpose is to graduate students who have developed a set of competencies (called our ""graduate dispositions"") beyond just academics that will allow them to lead our communities through future challenges in new ways.  Not only is this necessary for students to be successful in a fast-paced, diverse world, but also it has never been more important to the future of our country given the current national climate of divisiveness.  CWC LA is an independent 501(c)(3) organization with its own Board of Directors, but it is also part of the greater Citizens of the World Charter Schools national network.","CWC's school model focuses on a broad set of learning outcomes: our 11 ""graduate dispositions,"" or habits of character that represent our graduates' readiness to act in a certain way. The CWC graduate dispositions are clustered in three domains (""self,"" ""together"" and ""world""), highlighting how students must perform at high levels personally while also learning to work collaboratively with others. CWC has spent several years codifying the graduate dispositions, including how to measure results along these developmental pathways.  The CWC learning model describes how our schools help students meet the developmental benchmarks in the graduate dispositions. Just like a DNA molecule, different strands come together to support the growth of our students, staff and families, all of which have a strong equity lens: 

Strand #1: Core academics. CWC focuses on constructivism, project-based learning, readers and writers workshop, CGI, differentiation, gradual release of responsibility and data-informed instruction. All of these components come together to help students reach high levels of achievement in English Language Arts and math. CWC schools have consistently achieved strong results (for example, CWC Hollywood performs in the top 3% in math and top 7% in ELA out of 606 LAUSD, charter and magnet schools). 

Strand #2: Social emotional development. Our SEL curriculum and programs, which are embedded in all aspects of school life, help build the competencies we seek to develop in our diverse student population. Nurturing compassionate, adaptable, and innovative thinking begins with learning how to identify, self-regulate, and express a range of emotions. 

Strand #3: Difference and inclusion. A foundational tenet of the CWC model is that students with diverse backgrounds and perspectives should be together, learning to build self-management skills while thoughtfully working with others to better understand and impact the broader world. Our schools focus on how to support students, staff and families in developing their skills around difference and inclusion, including work around identify formation. This work is vital to closing the achievement gap and also helping students succeed once they graduate from CWC.

Leveraging advances in learning sciences and youth development practices we enable students to realize their unique talents through a personalized learning environment that fosters deeper learning; challenge them to master the most critical cognitive skills necessary for college and career readiness; and support them in developing linguistic proficiency that prepares them to collaborate with diverse communities and enter the global market. ,"Compass Academy graduates are lifelong learners and leaders, equipped to grow and learn, and ready to contribute to their local and global communities. Currently, Compass Academy serves 320 students in grades 6-8 of which 96% qualify for the Free or Reduced priced lunch, 60% are English Language Learners, 17% are eligible for an IEP, and 98% are Latinix.  As we build toward our aspirational state of a 6-12 learning experience, we will continue to put in place the robust set of design elements outlined above.  While we have not yet implemented all that we aspire to, we are committed to creating a new way of learning, defined by deep personalization and a commitment to our Compass Points and competency-based framework.  We believe student experiences have the potential to fortify strengths, address challenges, promote culture and community, and prepare students for the world beyond Compass Academy.  Compass Academy embodies these aspirations by adhering to the following beliefs: 
1. The power of students to actualize their unique potential as learners and leaders is within themselves. 
2. Compass Academy staff are dedicated to the social, emotional, and physical well-being of its students. 
3. Compass Academy prioritizes and focuses on bilingual/biliterate teaching and learning to leverage each student's ability to be successful in an interconnected world. 
4. Every individual who walks through Compass Academy's doors has something to add to the academic discourse regardless of race, primary language, ethnicity, gender, or sexual-orientation. 
5. Learning serves the greater good. Students have the opportunity to apply their learning to the real issues that matter most to them both in and out of school.   
6. Learning is powered by community and a deep sense of belonging. 
No longer bound by a single learning environment, our veteran learners will restructure school and, supported by teachers and support teams, create opportunities that align with Compass's competency-based framework, developing the agency, confidence, and competencies for setting their own paths and reaching their potential. In a single day, a learner may move from a village meeting to a math learning team, meeting for a workshop with a personal playlist of instruction to a community-based nutrition project rooted in a collaboration between a community garden, a team of university students, and a local restaurant, and end their day in a bilingual internship.  In response to the needs in our community, our approach to language acquisition is centered around the idea that building bridges between an already existent wealth of knowledge in one language will invariably assist in developing the multi-faceted language competencies required for rigorous academic standards in grade-level content areas. By making bilingual connections paramount in the classroom and incorporating an explicitly taught systematic English language curricula allows for the equal and equitable access to grade-level content.

Supported by a team of educators, students take online classes that allow them to learn at their own pace and to complete coursework in the evenings or on weekends to accommodate work or extra-curricular schedules. D-B EXCEL engages students in rigorous, standards-aligned instruction with a focus on project-based learning which allows students to demonstrate content mastery through products, performances, or presentations rather than traditional assessments or work products. D-B EXCEL was first envisioned in Spring 2014 and currently serves more than 200 students.","In the spring of 2014, a team of Kingsport City School leaders and administrators met to conceptualize an innovative course of action to meet the needs of the 21st century learner.

This vision was implemented in the fall of 2014 with the opening of DB-EXCEL (Excellence in a Creative Environment for Learning).  From its initial stages, the program included an intentional focus on professional learning and a continuous process of reflective evaluation. These mindsets extend throughout the entire school as a defined focus for both students and staff.

Development of Specific Mindsets: Ednovate believes in developing the mindsets needed to thrive in and persist through college and beyond, including Integrity, Entrepreneurialism, Mastery and Joy. Every aspect of their school design and model is purposefully designed to embody and develop these mindsets in our students.",The core purpose of our school is producing students who are prepared to use their college degrees and careers to make a positive multigenerational change.,"Our model is based on three pillars- personalization, purpose and community. By combining great teaching and cutting-edge technology, we work to provide a more customized college prep curriculum to the individual needs of each of our students. Secondly, we believe that every student should leave Ednovate having thought about the question: How do you plan to use your college degree and career to make a Positive Multigenerational Change?"" And thirdly, we believe in a schoolwide culture in which every student has a sense of belonging. Using these three pillars, our schools are tasked with innovating to achieve these goals, allowing for and encouraging autonomy with constraints.

65,77,Confirmed,Elmer G Bondy Intermediate,Pasadena,Texas,Pasadena ISD,Yes,Anonymous,The commitment to student centered blended learning for all students!,"The mission of Elmer G. Bondy Intermediate School is to provide students with a safe, nurturing environment in which they can achieve their highest level of academic excellence through personalized learning, enhance their self-worth and intrinsic motivation, and develop into responsible, productive leaders and members of society through a partnership with parents, educators and members of the Pasadena and greater community.  We are here to serve each and every child, every single day.  ","In the past, our school model has been a hybrid model (half our classes were the traditional teacher-led model & the other half were of the personalized learning instruction model).  For this upcoming year, personalized learning will be the campus-wide adopted instructional model.  We have been a successful partner with Summit Public Learning for 3 years.  Implementation of student outcomes such as integrating Cognitive Skills & Concepts, designing challenging content, and guiding students towards designated mindsets and behaviors called Habits of Success have transformed our educational philosophies.   
While our traditional academic settings have shown great success on state mandated assessments and have led district scores, they have not shown the growth in agency, reading fluency/comprehension, and progress.  Not meeting these areas, in our minds, is a failure in meeting our mission.  Students must be able to perform beyond minimum standards.  School should reflect the challenges the real world will presents.  Education must provide opportunities for failure, improvement, growth, success, and purpose all in one cycle or grade level.   Our schools strives to meet each student where they are and build them up to realize their own success.    
The implementation of personalized learning has provided our students with a voice to choose their path, their products, their timeline and more.   
Through mentoring, we are able to guide these young minds to understand how their choices will affect their outcomes.  Mentoring helps students understand the how and why a task must be completed and it is up to the student as to how they get there.  It also provides a dynamic opportunity for a teacher and student to cultivate a positive relationship that is built on trust, communication, and a true desire to help.  The teacher is no longer operating on a set number of days for one unit as the entire curriculum is at a student's fingertips.  The student who has quickly shown mastery of a topic no longer has to wait for the class in order to move on.    
Teachers have become more involved in using real-time data to direct instruction, workshops (small group, Tier 2/3 instruction), and projects.  Teachers have rediscovered their passion for education in realizing that they are not ""teaching to the test"" but they are rather equipping our students with the important skills to read, analyze, and apply learning to any situation.   Our school model continues to evolve as the needs of our students change each day.  This process is not static; it is a living, breathing instructional model that changes as quickly as the blink of an eye.   It is fast paced, exciting, challenging, rewarding, and we are loving every moment of the ride watching our students become responsible for their learning.

69,46,Confirmed,EPiC Elementary,Liberty,Missouri,Liberty Public Schools,Yes,The Learning Accelerator,EPIC is a project-based learning school which infuses district curated Open Education Resources (OER) to push student-centered and relevant learning.,"EPIC Elementary, founded on the dynamic vision of Every Person Inspired to Create, is a real-world learning environment, inspiring all learners to be creative and think big! EPiC is firmly grounded in three timeless pillars: Empower Creativity, Equip Students, and Engage Communities.  ENGAGING COMMUNITIES EPiC students learn in an environment that thrives on collaboration, not only within the classroom and across grade levels, but with the greater community through experts, partnerships, and community-based projects. Learners engage in the cultural, historic and civic amenities of Liberty and the greater Kansas City area to deepen and extend learning, providing purposeful experiences and focused reflection to discover knowledge, embrace skills and integrate values into their lives.  EMPOWERING CREATIVITY EPiC reimagines education by encouraging the in-depth exploration of topics as students participate in the adventures of learning. EPiC students apply their new knowledge by creating and exhibiting their learning to multiple audiences.   EQUIPPING LEARNERS We believe it is essential to equip students for their future by providing a personalized learning environment where students become effective collaborators, critical and creative thinkers, and communicators.  ","LEARNER AGENCY With our learner-centered approach, EPiC students have voice and choice, responsibility in their learning process, and ample opportunities to demonstrate learning in different ways. EPiC teachers build relationships to nurture education as a partnership and utilize inquiry-based instructional models designed to precipitate learning. Additionally, our teachers serve as coaches and provide one-on-one support and immediate feedback, consistently encouraging EPiC learners to remain self-confident in their abilities with a growth mindset. By constructing their learning paths and decreasing dependence on teacher-directed instruction, our learners deepen their critical thinking and questioning skills. Mobile technology continues to transform teaching and learning at EPiC. Within our 1:1 iPad blended learning environment, real-time feedback empowers our students to improve and grow, and it helps teachers adjust instruction to best meet the needs of each individual. Our blended learning platforms (e.g., iReady, Lexia Reading Core5, Reflex, Imagine Math) provide growth monitoring tools for both the student and teacher to track progress. For the past five years, we have continued to move from looking at results of learning in a reactive mindset to ""continual reflection in a proactive, growth mindset, ensuring all students move forward. Personal goal setting serves as a roadmap to expand and extend all learning, improving self-efficacy and motivation. Learners and coaches work together for growth and success.  

COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION As we strive to prepare our learners for an ever-changing world, we prioritize communication and collaboration, two bedrock skills. We believe learning is influenced and enhanced through interpersonal relationships, authentic collaborative work, and communication with others, both inside and outside the classroom. The ubiquitous use of technology within our learning environment has strengthened communication and feedback between learners, teachers, parents, and our larger community. Virtual learning platforms such as iTunes U enables EPiC learners to work together concurrently to manage projects, develop ideas, and provide feedback.  

CREATION EPiC learners are not only consumers of content but also creators of original content, often designing products to share beyond the walls of the classroom. Using a variety of digital tools and resources, they actively discover and curate information to make meaning, construct knowledge, and produce creations. With such vast information available online, students learn to evaluate the quality and efficacy of the information, helping them to deepen their understanding and widen their perspective of a given topic. Furthermore, because technology tools help us connect with people, ideas, and audiences, our learners develop a deeper sense of pride and responsibility in their work.   How do our learners make the world different?   Everywhere they go, with iPad in hand, our students document and publish learning stories and creative products on public platforms such as blogs, visual stories, digital books, and digital portfolios. We love to share our collective learning with the world on social media. As students discover and identify the challenges in this world, they actively create to change the world for the better by finding solutions and raising awareness. 

CODING We believe coding is a necessary language for all learners and crosses all content areas. Over the last three years, our coding instruction has evolved from sporadic to immersive across all grade levels. We began with exploring coding concepts and vocabulary to developing a scope and sequence of skills, fluid and ever-changing to meet the needs of our learners as they attain knowledge and fluency earlier and earlier in their school career. As our evolutionary process continues, teachers have begun to create viable coding links to content areas and connections to the world, such as storytelling, creating music, and mathematical computation. Coding instruction begins in Studio K with a focus on sequencing and loops using iPad apps such as Kodable, Tynker, and Scratch, Jr. By Studio Four, as learners master skills, we move into Swift Playgrounds and Scratch.  Coding has cultivated learner-centered instruction for everyone, including our teachers. With side by side learning, our students act as role models, modeling perseverance and relevant skills to lead learners. Our learners come to us as active participants in their learning environment. We believe our job is to facilitate and grow that learner agency throughout their time at EPiC.",Mature and going strong (more than 3 years),4-5 years,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,1,,,1,1,,,,,1,,,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,"Yes, this is accurate.","Yes, this is accurate.",4,,,4,,291854003253,MO-024090-4220024090,,Regular School,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,KG,5,Elementary,300,–,,9,3.00%,12,4.00%,3,1.00%,266,88.67%,10,3.33%,–,,300,Yes participating without using any Provision or the CEO,Suburban,"Suburban, Large",18,6.0%,60,20.0%,Not a Title I school,296,4.7,0.7

This flexibility has enabled Fannie Lou to create a robust portfolio assessment system where students present and defend their work and learning through their pathway to graduation. In the highest poverty Congressional District in the nation, Fannie Lou Hamer partners with the Children's Aid Society to provide out of school learning experiences, health and counseling services, and summer youth employment for 70-80% of students each summer. Additionally, the school focuses intensely on teacher collaboration, developing a school-wide schedule to allow team professional development and collaboration for three hours weekly. Fannie Lou's focus on social justice and student activism has resulted most recently in the students petitioning local legislators to re-name their street to honor the legacy of Fannie Lou Hamer. Additionally, each year the students host a birthday party for Fannie Lou Hamer, with events to educate the community about her contributions so social justice. In the past two years, the school has quickly built an internship program under the direction of a teacher who is herself an alumna of Fannie Lou. ","The fundamental aim of Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School is to teach students to use their minds well and prepare them to live productive, socially useful, and personally satisfying lives.  The Habits of Mind form the basis of our efforts to move students toward these goals.  The school's academic program stresses intellectual development and political and social involvement in our society.  Five Habits of Mind are stressed.  VIEWPOINT:  Identifying and understanding various perspectives on an issue. EVIDENCE:  Being able to support a particular point of view and critically examine different forms of evidence. CONNECTIONS:  Seeing larger patterns and connections between ideas, the individual and the larger society. CONJECTURE:  Being able to envision alternatives and ask ""what if?"" RELEVANCE:  Understanding the importance of an issue and asking ""what difference does it make?""  The Habits of Mind are at the heart of all our work along with sound work habits and care and concern for others:  Habits of Work and Heart.  The curriculum of FLHFHS affirms the central importance of students learning how to learn, how to reason, and how to investigate complex issues that require collaboration, personal responsibility and a tolerance for uncertainty.  It is inquiry-based, emphasizing projects which students design and carry out themselves, with teachers as guides and coaches.  Communication skills, including reading, writing, public speaking, and critical listening, are developed in all subject areas.  Our school emphasizes getting students involved in Extended Learning Opportunities outside of school, focused on building students' experiences, resumes and learning beyond the classroom.  We have partnerships with dozens of organizations with whom our students participate in programs after school, for internships, and during the summer.   ","Based on a belief in the ability of all learners to succeed and excel, Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School (FLHFHS) seeks to provide all students with a complete, rounded, academically rigorous education that is both broad and deep in its scope.  Aware of the varied degrees of preparedness of students as they enter our school, we seek to provide a wide range of support so that each student can realize his/her potential and identify and achieve his/her personal goals.  The tone of the school deliberately stresses high expectations and trust, as well as fairness, generosity, and respect for diversity.   Our school is guided by the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools.  These principles include: LESS IS MORE:  It is important to understand a few concepts in-depth rather than knowing many things superficially.  Learning how to learn is most important. 
PERSONALIZATION:  Every student should be known well.  While courses of study are universal and unified, teaching and learning are personalized. 
HIGH STANDARDS:  Work is always central to what we do.  Upon completion of high school, students must exhibit mastery of understanding in the major disciplines. 
STUDENT-AS-WORKER:  Teachers coach students, encouraging them to find answers for themselves.  Students discover and learn by doing, rather than simply repeating what textbooks or teachers say.   
In addition to intellectual development, the school's academic program stresses political/social involvement in our society.  Our school is named after a grassroots community leader who fearlessly led the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to the National Convention in pursuit of people's basic civil rights.  Her courage in the face of challenge and her tenacity in struggling for justice are values that we hope will inspire our own students to become activists in their own communities.   In Division I (grades 9 and 10), there is a common core curriculum for all students organized around Mathematics/Science and the Humanities.  Students also complete a two-year sequence including the study of a second language, community outreach, advisory, and health.   In Division II (grades 11 and 12), each student, along with his/her advisor, draws up a personal program of study designed to prepare the student for graduation.  Students complete coursework in six major areas:  English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, the Arts, and Advisory.  Students also take elective classes in such areas as Autobiography, Computer Science, Social Issues, and Internship.  Opportunities for advanced college-level coursework are also available.

Parker Charter Essential School is open by lottery admissions to all residents of Massachusetts in grades seven through twelve. Parker is a progressive school which emphasizes learning to use one's mind well and putting the student at the center of the educational process. Students are known well at Parker. School climate is built on trust, decency, and democracy. Both classroom-level assessment practices and whole school assessment systems at Parker, include progressive practices that have been honed for more than twenty years. Teacher and administrators facilitate and design inquiry-based projects for grades 7- 12 students and support those projects within a school-wide performance-based promotion system. The school focuses on inquiry and performance assessment at the all levels (including choice-based culminating independent projects and senior projects) providing systems and structures that are designed to support this kind of performance assessment model (including schedules, reporting systems, and graduation requirements).","Established in 1995 as one of Massachusetts' first charter public schools, the Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School (Parker) has a progressive, student-centered approach to secondary schooling: our primary goal is to help adolescents learn to use their minds well; we help students learn to think, solve problems, and become resilient, resourceful learners. Our mastery-based promotion system is built on portfolios of high-quality student work products and public exhibitions of learning rather than traditional letter grades or grade point averages. Other key design features include robust teacher collaboration and team-teaching, personal learning plans for each student, early-career teacher induction, and outward-facing dissemination efforts.     Parker is a regional public school located in Central Massachusetts, comprised of students in grades 7-12, primarily from Worcester and Middlesex Counties.  The school is located in Devens, a former military base, which is currently in the process of redevelopment and revitalization. In addition to the charter public school, Parker increases its impact internationally by running an influential professional development center on its campus. The Sizer Teachers Center works with 200-500 educators per year, providing workshops, custom visits, school coaching, and consulting services to educators, schools, and districts.

Their course offerings are determined by the students and teachers together, and there is a strong focus on collaboration and interdisciplinary work.  From a recent article on wnyc.org: """"From the minute we opened we had a very diverse population and we needed to navigate that,"" says Danielle Salzberg, principal of Frank McCourt High School, on the Upper West Side, which opened in 2010. ""Kids come with different educational backgrounds and different socioeconomic backgrounds. We opened our doors fully aware that we were going to be meeting different kids' needs in different kinds of ways.""  To meet those needs, Salzberg and her team turned to a mastery-based model.  ""It's the best way to provide feedback to students that allows them to understand themselves and be empowered as learners,"" Salzberg says. ""We focus a lot on student engagement. What are we doing to challenge their thinking and not just have them be compliant?""  The school is thriving.

80,56,Confirmed,Fred Tjardes School of Innovation,Greeley,Colorado,GREELEY-EVANS WELD COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT 6,No,Springpoint,"Opened in fall 2017, the Fred Tjardes School of Innovation (FTSOI) is a K-8 school in Greeley, Colorado. The school was designed by a team of teachers, who are the co-founders and current lead collaborators of the school. The objective was to create a school that serves a population that is representative of Greeley with demographics to match that of the community. The current student population is 50.8 % white and 49.1% Hispanic or multiple races, with 49% of the population receiving free or reduced lunch. Designed based on the belief that children are naturally curious and creative learners, the school's mission is to foster an atmosphere that encourages risk-taking and curiosity so that students are empowered to become problem-finders and problem-solvers. One of the hallmarks of FTSOI is the fidelity to its design foundations (mission, instructional vision, core values, and design priorities). The design foundations are not just a series of statements, but rather serve as the foundation for decisions and structures throughout the school and are evident in their daily practice. This leads to a school that iterates on the execution of this design, but still maintains a strong identity grounded in its founding principles. Students explore theme-based topics (loops), with cross-content connections that ask them to learn about topics and concepts in greater depth, in grade level bands. Ingrained in the heart of the school's culture is openness to failure and trying again. The goal is to make failure feel safe so that students aren't afraid to try new things. Additionally, teacher and leadership roles have been reimagined at this school. Teachers are known as Band Collaborators and generally teach two grade levels of students within their band. School leadership responsibilities are distributed among three educators who are both Band Collaborators and Lead Collaborators.","At TSOI, we believe that learning should be an exciting part of childhood. Our curriculum is designed in a way that taps into a child's natural curiosity to explore and create. Students explore simple theme based topics (or loops) in grade level bands instead of arbitrary grade levels. The loops have cross content connections, which ask students to learn about topics and concepts with more depth. For example, students may be exploring the loop ""Movement."" While doing this they may learn about art and music movements, learn the math and physics of motion, explore the historical and geographical reasons why people have moved, explore and practice movement used in exercise, and read literature around movements like the Civil Rights. As students develop the skills and knowledge on the topic, we will guide them as they develop presentations and projects as ways to demonstrate learning and impact their community. Then, students may take the information to look at the future of movement or create something that utilizes motion or artistic movements. We call them loops because by the end, the students will be able to complete the loop by informing others about the topic through their innovation.

They were selected in 2015 from a pool of 44 applicants from 13 states. Two years of work, travel, research, networking, planning and passion, including a KIPP Fisher Fellowship, went into the design and launch of their school. Future Public School is a hands-on STEM charter school for students in an area with a large population of low-income, diverse students and families, which aligns with its mission and vision to provide more equitable educational opportunities for all students. At full enrollment in 2022 the school will serve 576 students in grades K-8. Future values depth over speed and students dive into science through cross-curricula projects. Beginning in the early grades, students develop familiarity with scientific inquiry and critical thinking strategies as they put these skills into practice via STEM. The school innovates throughout. It saved substantial expense by negotiating an agreement with the local Boys and Girls Club to share their gym and cafeteria spaces, which are vacant during the school day. The school and Club signed a 30-year joint use agreement, which provides the school with exclusive access to the Boys and Girls Club during the school day, and the Boys and Girls Club with exclusive use of the school's learning spaces after school and during the summer. ","Future Public School's vision is to develop engineers of the future and of our community. We approach engineering as a framework of problem-solving - both in the scientific arena and in building community through an equity-based approach. Future equip students with the knowledge, skills, and character to succeed in college and the future world through a commitment to innovative STEM programming, equity, and individualization.  ","Our success is driven by: 
Innovative STEM Implementation: We build upon the technological fluency students bring to school, incorporate STEM across the curriculum, expand learning opportunities, and heighten human potential. 
Safe, nurturing, and flexible environments: Neuroscience research reveals that students need physical and emotional safety in order to take risks and learn from successes and mistakes. The school is built around the student, with flexible learning spaces to accommodate learners of all types. With more time for learning and extracurricular activities, the school day is reimagined and our students never imagine missing a day of school. 
Equity, identity, and access: Increased access to high-quality education for all students is our goal. Building up and affirming the strengths of every student through relationships and restorative practices further creates an individual sense of purpose. Zip code or parental income should not determine student destiny. We build bridges and make community together. 
High Expectations: We expect 100% of students to be prepared to go to and through college.

89,126,Confirmed,Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy,Chicago,Illinois,Chicago Public Schools District 299,Yes,Illinois State Board of Education,"Teachers and leaders at Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy in Chicago reported that students struggled to understand their grades and felt uncertain about how to improve. In 2016, the school shifted to competency-based education to provide more clarity and foster more student ownership over learning. Brooks is one of 11 schools in Chicago Public Schools participating in Illinois' competency-based education pilot program. In competency-based learning, educators assess and advance students based on demonstrated mastery of specific skills, abilities, and knowledge.       

Brooks Principal Shannae Jackson and her staff created rubrics detailing the learning standards and what mastery of each standard looks like. The rubrics express clear expectations for each performance or project, which helps students self-assess their path forward for improving and/or progressing to the next unit. Students can work at their own pace without feeling left behind or waiting for the rest of the class. Students receive scores on a scale of 0 to 4. A 4 reflects exceeding mastery of the standard, a three reflects mastery, a 2 reflects a minor conceptual error, a 1 reflects a major conceptual error, and a 0 reflects no attempt at the standard or an attempt unrelated to the content. Students receive letter grades based on the percentage of standards met.      

""Students are starting to talk about needing to demonstrate mastery,"" said Principal Jackson. ""They'll say, 'This is exactly what I need to do. This is exactly the learning target or standard I have not demonstrated mastery in so I need to do more practice work or go into tutoring.' They can articulate those things clearly. You can hear the language change in the hallways. They're like, 'I'm going in for the retake for the formative. Have you reached mastery yet?' That's because that is the discourse happening around the building."" ","Gwendolyn Brooks College Preparatory Academy (""Brooks"") is a high-poverty, high-minority, yet high-performing 7th-12th grade selective enrollment urban public high school nestled in the Roseland community on the far South Side of the City of Chicago.   At Brooks, 98% of the student body is African American and Hispanic while 70% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch.  Drawn from boundaries that span the entire City of Chicago, the student demographic is traditionally underrepresented and underserved in college and advanced careers; however, as a result of the school's intensive college planning and support initiatives, Brooks boasts a 96% college graduation rate and 90% of students attend 4 year universities.  As an institution of learning, Brooks exists as a singularly unique educational environment for each student to learn at high levels; to earn admission with essential scholarship support to excellent colleges and universities; and to thrive and contribute in the world they will inherit as adults. To fully realize these imperatives, Brooks is committed to advancing personalized learning through competency-based education, curriculum, instruction, and assessment; flexible use of talent, time, and resources; growth mindset culture among adults and youth; and extensive community engagement.  Brooks subscribes to a student first philosophy; the school values and validates their voices and views students as co-designers of the learning environment.  Brooks provides a rigorous college preparatory curriculum for all students in 7th-12th grade.  All foundational courses are taught at the Honors level while Advanced Placement and Dual Credit course offerings are extensively represented in each academic discipline and follow a personalized/competency-based approach to grading, instructional practices, and learning for students.",,Early stage (0-3 years),4-5 years,,1,1,1,,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,1,1,,1,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,1,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,"Yes, this is mostly accurate.",,3,,,4,,170993002031,IL-15-016-2990-25-1501629900788,,Regular School,No,Not reported,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,7,12,High,915,3,0.33%,2,0.22%,146,15.96%,751,82.08%,6,0.66%,6,0.66%,1,0.11%,915,Not reported,Urban,"City, Large",676,73.9%,,,Not reported,838,6.7,0.0

With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Holmes Central to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.  In addition to these unique human resources, the blended model also provides students the opportunity to participate in intensive, residential preparatory programs throughout the year at local MS-based universities including the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University. The Global Teaching Project is excited to nominate Holmes Central HS because of the tremendous efforts it is undertaking to provide historically underserved students access to AP courses. Notwithstanding Holmes Central's significant challenges, it serves as the lone high school for Holmes County, the poorest of Mississippi's 82 counties. The blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort. As the model expands and continues to improve, the program will help to develop and prepare a pipeline of talented, high-achieving students from Mississippi's most rural and impoverished districts for post-secondary success.","The CORE purpose is to educate the whole child in the Holmes County Consolidated School District.

Part of the framework to fully operationalize Design Thinking in the schools is a commitment to supporting environments of hope for adults and students. For students to fully engage in a constructivist learning environment they must identify with a sense of purpose and agency in order to be motivated and empowered to participate. Towards this end, IDEATE has developed a framework that deploys tenets of Hope Theory research to support students. Hope Theory harnesses the interaction of goal setting, agency development, and pathway knowledge to motivate and empower students. Primarily developed during Student Advisory (5 days/week at the high school, 1/week at the middle school), students are supported in imagining a life beyond school. Advisory leaders assist students in setting positive (near-, mid- and long-term) goals; understanding the work that needs to be accomplished to realize those goals; and realizing their own agency and empowerment to act on their goals.

104,97,Confirmed,John Barry Elementary School,Meriden,Connecticut,Meriden Public Schools,No,CT Center for School Change,"This is a true turnaround story. It was a school about to be taken over, and now has seen dramatic results in the state accountability index (39.8% increase in a few short years). It has also been identified by the state as a school of distinction for 2018 SBAC results. John Barry and the Meriden Public Schools were awarded the highly competitive American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Innovation Grant  which helps facilitate Barry's transition to an Extended Learning Time School. Extended Learning Time School students receive 100 more minutes of instruction and enrichment a day, which equals 40 more school days a year. Positive changes in school culture, which have created a welcoming and caring school climate, have had a positive impact on student attendance; chronic absenteeism has decreased by 22%. Through the use of Google Classroom in every John Barry grade level, teachers are able to personalize learning to meet the needs of all students by differentiating the assigned work. All classrooms are 1:1 digital learning environments that utilize blended learning strategies. Reading instruction is personalized daily through adaptive reading programs (Freckle, Imagine Learning) which adjust to the students ""just right"" reading level. K-5 students are engaged in rigorous math activities that are designed for flexible groups and encourage student discourse with a focus on mathematical processes, vocabulary, and the use of multiple strategies. Math instruction is personalized through the use of adaptive math programs (Freckle, ST Math and MyMath) that allow students to work at their own pace based upon their performance     ","The core purpose of John Barry Elementary School is to provide our community a place of acceptance. All who join the John Barry family are supported, ensured safety and are provided a well rounded, differentiated learning experience. The professionals at John Barry are driven to meet the needs of all students and maximize their potential as individuals. Our goal is to continuously empower all members of the John Barry family to thrive inside and outside of the Barry walls. ""The Barry Way"" has created a community that respects being safe, responsible and respectful. We will continue to surpass academic goals while supporting personal growth.   ","John Barry is a Expanded Learning Time elementary school. John Barry's re-engineered day provides an additional 100 minutes for instruction, enrichment, and teacher collaboration. All work together to implement innovative programs and effective curricula keyed to the educational, social and economic challenges of an increasingly diverse population. John Barry Elementary School is the first Meriden Public School to be completely 1:1.  All classes, in all grade levels K through 5, are equipped with a dedicated Chromebook Cart. Barry also has a mega computer lab with 75 seats and another smaller lab with 30 seats. Our technology-rich curriculum infuses resources from multiple digital content partners including Imagine Learning, myON, Mind Research Institute's ST Math, MobyMax, Mystery Science, Reading A-Z, Freckle and Vocabulary.com.  Teachers are able to personalize learning based on both formative and summative assessment data.  Students regularly use choice boards (must do/can do) to select the digital tool that both matches their interests and meets their learning needs.  To support their digital transformation, John Barry launched the Tech Buddies program which pairs older students with younger students, showing them how to use educational technology tools. Tech Buddies was featured by Edutopia Schools That Work and the feature received over 20,000 views.  All Barry students participate in Math and Literature Through Technology program for a minimum of 45 minutes each week.  This curriculum is aligned with the ISTE Standards for Students and provides an opportunity to explore topics such as digital citizenship, coding, and robotics. The district reading curriculum is directly aligned to the Common Core State Standards and taught during a two-hour instructional block. Each unit uses the lens of an umbrella standard. Teachers deliver daily extension activities using weekly text and driven by skill based standards. Barry teachers have embedded the process of inner dialogue and questioning into the process of planning. This practice explicitly highlights two important points.  First, it focuses on skills across grade levels using aligned language and higher level expectations as students grow. Second, it gives each lesson a purpose beyond designated content for both students and teachers, encouraging real-world application, inquiry, and engagement while learning.  Instructional coaching and peer observations ensure continuous rollout, reflection, and revision. Google Classroom is used across grade levels. Teachers use Google Classroom to group students and differentiate assignments.  Google Forms is used to collect data in conjunction with the extensive use of Google Sheets to aid in the analysis process. This supports alignment of data across grade levels, facilitates the creation of next steps, and increases teacher awareness of reflective instructional practices and student needs. myON provides access to a library of over 6,000 digital books that students can select based on Lexile and interest.  Meriden's data warehouse provides timely benchmark and Smarter Balance Assessment (SBA) actionable data. Teachers also analyze SBA Interim Assessments, observations, unit tests,  anecdotal notes, and software data.  Next steps involve continuing to improve reading achievement across all subgroups and promoting lifelong readers.  Barry's  K-5  math curriculum is aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in math, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards, and Smarter Balance Assessment (SBA) assessments. Taught for 60-80 minutes daily, the program emphasizes rigor, conceptual understanding, and connection to prior concepts and skills. Students are engaged in rigorous math activities in all classrooms. Differentiated lessons allow students to work in flexible groupings so that all students master standards. Daily discussion groups encourage student discourse with a focus on vocabulary and mathematical processes. Students are challenged to find multiple strategies. They are prepared for college and career readiness through problems requiring critical thinking, problem-solving and integration of mathematical concepts. Barry's approach utilizes a student discourse model which promotes understanding of mathematical processes and concepts. Rigorous activities such as error analysis and performance tasks promote higher order thinking. Students work in a 1:1 digital environment using adaptive software such as Freckle.  ST Math is a visually driven online program that builds conceptual understanding of math concepts as well as skill development. Both programs are aligned with the core curriculum. McGraw Hill  My Math is a resource used by teachers for planning and implementation of the math curriculum. Students have access to all online math resources at home.  During team PLC meetings, teachers analyze student data from unit assessments, ST Math, Freckle, and SBA Interim Assessments. Vertical alignment allows teachers to ensure that their strategies and content prepare students the next level of material.  Next steps include continuous improvement of student achievement across subgroups to prepare students for higher level thinking and real-world problem-solving.

KM Explore was created by a group of teacher leaders who were committed in creating learner-centered environments at the elementary level. This model has been in existence for over 5 years and is recognized as a national K-5 learner-centered model. The foundation to their model includes the following five pillars: ""foundation"" with the following pillars:      
Optimal Learning Spaces     
Generative Curriculum     
Multi-Age Learning     
Habits of Mind

Here is what they said when we interviewed them in the first year of this model: ""Our goal at KM Explore is to help a learner be an architect of how their learning will look. Just as each building in a community looks different, each plan the learner builds will look different as well. If we start this ""blueprint"" right away in kindergarten, their is no telling what their ""building"" of learning will look like into high school and beyond!"" I am nominating KM Explore as a personalized learning model for many reasons. Here are just a few: KM Explore involves learners in the design of a different kind of school.  By being multi-age in structure, community-based in function, and integrated in its curriculum design, KM Explore learners provide evidence of learning in a manner that is meaningful to them.  A fluid and adaptable schedule removes traditional boundaries of learning. Integrated curriculum design, the creative process, and high level questioning is woven throughout the learning experience. The fundamentals of reading, writing, and math are foundational to this generative curriculum as they are embedded and integrated into the day-to-day work.

111,"55, 67",Confirmed,Latitude 37.8 High School,Oakland,California,Education for Change,No,"Anonymous, Rogers Family Foundation","Latitude 37.8 is devoted to the spirit, community, and history of Oakland, California. Located in the city's Fruitvale neighborhood, Latitude uses an academically rigorous, hands-on approach to education that sets high standards for students and equips them with practical skills to succeed in college and career. In addition to traditional classes, students spend much of their school time in the community: volunteering for local nonprofits, interning at local businesses, meeting with mentors, interviewing local experts and professionals for class projects, and learning about the vibrant, complex city around them. Students gain exposure to the wide range of career options in the Bay Area and beyond, while developing deep connections to the community in which they live.

Latitude is a brand new high school that blends the best of High Tech High's project-based and deeper learning model with Big Picture Learning's emphasis on work-based learning.","Too many high school students today, especially in Oakland, express that they do not know why they are learning what they are learning or how it matters to them as individuals. Students become disengaged with their schooling experiences and, as a result, 1 out of 3 Oakland students drops out of high school. Latitude's model gives students the opportunity to grapple with interdisciplinary problems through experiences outside of school, working with professionals in authentic settings to connect what they are learning to their future. By extending learning beyond the walls of a school building, Latitude's learning experiences demystify access to the full range of Bay Area career opportunities and expand each student's sense of possibility for their future.  ","As described in the infographic above, the Latitude learning experience is organized around four key structures that operationalize each of our design principles and employ our key practices:  

Studios: Latitude's studio model will engage students in experiential project-based learning grounded in the city of Oakland, exploring its cultural dynamism, entrepreneurial assets, and unique challenges. Instructors will facilitate learning experiences in authentic settings, in partnership with professionals from the community. We are using high quality project based learning curriculum that was developed at High Tech High. These projects are aligned to common core and Latitude's competencies. Students' project work will be organized into two interdisciplinary studios, Humanities Studio and Science & Design Studio, as they investigate, document, and develop creative solutions to real challenges confronting the Oakland community. The benefits of operating within a professional studio are many: from Day 1, Latitude students will have the opportunity to step into the shoes of professionals, to begin building a portfolio of work, to take on authentic leadership roles, and to develop the agency, skills and methods of inquiry that will facilitate their pursuit of independent projects in later phases.  For an example of the first project in phase one, see here. (Students will earn UC A-G credit for English, History, Math, Science, Visual Arts, and College-Prep Elective.)  

Workshops will complement and enrich the work happening in our Studios, with a focus on developing powerful literacy and mathematical thinking skills. Our strategies are anchored in research and personalized to meet every student where they are to ensure that students with unfinished learning or special learning needs receive the supports they need. Research has shown that personalized learning without clear competencies can lead to low rigor and expectations. At Latitude, all students will receive personalized support as they work to achieve mastery of competencies aligned to college and career readiness.   Our vision for Literacy Workshops is to ensure that skill development feels purposeful and contextualized. For instance, when tackling a design project on supporting the transition of newcomer youth to Oakland, in Literacy Workshop, students would read complex grade-level texts about immigration policies, as well as stories about immigrants, including students' own. For ELL students, workshop is the space where systematic English Language Development is provided, complementing the integrated ELD they receive in the context of Studio projects. Additionally, these workshop sessions will be supplemented by resources from UnboundED, EL Achieve, and other Common Core-aligned curriculum to ensure students are exposed and grappling with grade-level appropriate complex texts.   In Math Workshop, students develop the key competencies of Mathematical Problem-Solving, Mathematical Argumentation and Reflection. Latitude's math workshops are rooted in the research of Stanford University's Jo Boaler and Vanderbilt University's Ilana Horn. The team of math teachers have attended the Standards Institute run by Unbounded and will use the available open source common core aligned curriculum for the math content in year 1. Additionally, math teachers will supplement the UnboundED curriculum with resources from the TRU (Teaching for Robust Understanding) framework developed by Alan Schoenfeld at UC Berkeley.  All of our math teachers will be trained in best practices developed by the Math for America fellowship and the Knowles Teaching Foundation. Students will develop core mathematical mindsets through an inquiry-oriented math approach, exploring multiple methods of solving group-worthy problems and engaging in mathematical discussions to defend their reasoning.  

Advisory: Cultivating a strong sense of belonging will permeate all aspects of the Latitude experience, but advisory will be students' home within the school throughout their time at Latitude. Advisory will provide students with the space and support to reflect on their evolving sense of identity. Throughout their time at Latitude, students will develop an ever clearer sense of purpose about the lives they hope to lead and reflect on how their values and beliefs align with their aspirations. The advisor's job is to know each student and their family deeply, so that they can support each student's unique college and career goals through a personalized educational plan. To support students with our competencies around navigating systems and self-advocacy, community involvement, building strong mentorship networks, and acquiring knowledge outside of school, our advisory program will use curriculum developed by Big Picture Learning and tools from Project Wayfinder.  Extended Learning Opportunities (ELOs) â€šÃ„Ã® Advisors will support students in securing ELOs, such as internships or service learning experiences, off campus. They will coordinate Networking Power Lunches and Career Site Visits with professionals in the community. Advisors will support advisees in conducting regular informational interviews, so that the task of networking becomes second nature. Students will have the option of identifying their own ELOs, or they may choose an ELO from one of several core community partners that Latitude will cultivate. Within advisory, students will have dedicated time to reflect on their ELOs and to curate a digital portfolio that documents their evolving intellectual and career interests, as well as a virtual ""rolodex"" of their ever expanding network of professional contacts.   Latitude is a gradual release model. In the earlier phases, learning experiences in the community are scaffolded and chaperoned by teachers. As students build independence and grow their academic and professional skills, they will have increasing opportunities to engage in independent ELOs, or Extended Learning Opportunities.

WHY IS PERSONALIZED LEARNING A GOOD IDEA? When it comes to small children, we know they will learn to crawl, walk, and talk at different rates. We encourage them when they make progress, and we help them when they stumble. If a child learns quickly, we help them progress to the next stage, and if a child is struggling, we intervene and give them the support they need to be successful. We understand at this age that every child is unique and learns at his or her own pace. Ironically, secondary schools are typically built on the assumption that all children should be treated more or less alike, and one size fits all. Students often report that they are bored in school, either because they are ahead and the class is moving too slow, or they don't understand the curriculum and have fallen behind. Personalized learning allows students to progress at their own pace with the support needed to be successful in a future that will require competencies unfamiliar to earlier generations. MENTOR TEACHERS In personalized learning, the teacher-student bond doesn't matter less; it matters more. Each student is paired to work with a mentor teacher and remain with their mentor all four years. Teachers get to know students and their families. Students know that we know them, and more importantly that we care about them. Personalized learning creates deeper teacher-student bonds because the teacher has to know the student to customize a program and offer advice. Mentor teachers may meet with other teachers and students to discuss student needs and to help students plan. We believe it is critical that each student has a caring adult to supervise, counsel, and interact with them frequently. This helps students feel more comfortable in school and builds a sense of security. Students are no longer just faces and identification numbers who sit in a class for a short time each day; instead, they are individuals with their own unique sets of concerns, problems, and attitudes.   ADULT TUTORS AVAILABLE It is not unusual for even very able students to struggle in certain classroom situations and with one or more school subjects. Adult tutors will be available on a daily basis to help any student throughout the day. One of the key advantages of the tutoring program is that the tutor is able to give the student one-on-one attention, taking into account their abilities as an individual and their personal learning style. Tutors are not only available for students who need remediation, but also for maintenance, support, test prep, and enrichment. Tutors can help students focus on building concrete skills, work on strategies to help students succeed, and help with understanding difficult concepts.   INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES  Competency-Based Blended Learning Model The blended learning model incorporates highly qualified teachers and a competency-based digital curriculum to deliver a personalized learning environment for each student. This model is an efficient approach that allows us to meet the individual needs of each student. Instruction using this model is delivered through a classroom teacher using digital curriculum that is web-based in a face-to-face setting. Many different formats and schedules are possible, and teachers utilize whole class instruction, small-group instruction, and individual instruction.  Blended courses are a mix of traditional and online classroom structures. Competency-based learning requires students to demonstrate proficiency in each skill or concept prior to moving on to new material.   

WHAT ROLE DOES TECHNOLOGY PLAY? Technology is no longer a supplement. Most children today are technologically fluent and make daily use of laptops and mobile devices. In a blended learning environment that leverages our one-to-one technology, students are not bound by their classroom walls in terms of access to information, knowledge, and experts. A digitally-rich learning environment provides students with the context and relevancy for learning that they want and is important to the development of 21st century skills to ensure a successful academic and work life.  So, the keys to personalized learning are providing access to appropriate technology, for the teacher to provide appropriate support when it's indicated, and to give students flexibility around physical space, learning time frames, and instructional pacing.  With this new paradigm of personalized instruction, instructors have an unprecedented opportunity to redefine their roles and scale personalized education like never before. ""School"" is no longer defined merely as a physical space, classrooms lined with rows of desks and a teacher who lectures at the front of the room - nor does a student's required curriculum have to involve a one-size-fits-all model that uses a single textbook. Anytime, anywhere learning that bridges formal and informal learning experiences is connected through the effective use of advanced technologies. Digital learning modalities combined with competency-based progressions prove fundamental to modernizing education systems that meet each student's unique needs.

119,82,Confirmed,Madison Palmer High School,Marks,Mississippi,none provided,No,Global Teaching Project,"The Advanced Placement (AP) Access Pilot Program is an innovative and first-of-its-kind blended learning program that provides promising high school students access to the advanced coursework they need to achieve their full potential, but which rural, underserved schools such as Madison Palmer HS otherwise could not offer due to limited resources and a chronic, and worsening, shortage of qualified teachers.  With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Madison Palmer HS to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.  In addition to these unique human resources, the blended model also provides students the opportunity to participate in intensive, residential preparatory programs throughout the year at local MS-based universities including the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University. 
The Global Teaching Project is excited to nominate Madison Palmer HS because of the tremendous efforts it is undertaking to provide historically underserved students access to AP courses.  Notwithstanding the school's significant challenges, Quitman County, where the school is located, is among the poorest counties in Mississippi. The blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.  As the model expands and continues to improve, the program will help to develop and prepare a pipeline of talented, high-achieving students from Mississippi's most rural and impoverished districts for post-secondary success.","The core purpose of Madison S.

120,88,Confirmed,Magnolia Montessori For All,Austin,Texas,Montessori For All,No,Next Gen Learning Challenges,"Sara Cotner's vision for this school was to integrate three approaches that are too often defended as ""churches"" by their advocates: Montessori, no-excuses/standards-based, and digital/blended. Her idea was to take the most important and valuable elements from each approach and integrate them to create a new model. Our view is that she and her team have been able to do exactly that.  Too often, educators and reformers see only a narrow set of pedagogical approaches supporting a commitment to high achievement on standards-based metrics. Montessori for All is attempting to demonstrate that you can generate high achievement on state-generated standards through approaches that are more whole-child oriented. The schools is very obviously a Montessori school, first and foremost. But unlike most Montessori schools, this one has mapped high-expectation standards against and within Montessorian approaches and is supporting the work with various forms of enabling technology.   Montessori has long been understood to be a model that does an excellent job of preparing children in holistic ways. It is faulted, sometimes, for falling short in enabling its students to demonstrate high achievement across traditional curriculum areas. Montessori for All is a noteworthy effort to connect the strongest aspects of the model with high-expectation standards matched to 21st century needs.",Montessori For All seeks to build a more just and peaceful world by cultivating diverse leaders of the future who find purpose and joy in their own lives and advocate for others to be able to do the same.,"One additional thing I would like to add is that our model is grounded in child development theory. We believe there are distinct phases in children's lives (0-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24). What people need at each stage is different, and our instructional model and our physical spaces shift to accommodate the new needs of learners at each level. For example, children from Birth to 6 are incredibly self-centered and self-focused as they work to build functional independence. In our Birth-6 classrooms, you will see lessons being given one-on-one and children working at individual work spaces (at tables or on the floor). However, from 6-12, children shift to building mental independence and they have a Reasoning Mind. All of their lessons and follow-up work happen in small groups so that they we can channel their design to reason and talk into productive work.

Many are in the foster system or residential treatment via the juvenile justice. Norris does not know when learners enter whether they will stay for 3 months or 3 years but is committed to developing an individualized pathway for each learner around 4 domains: Wellness, Academic, Employability, and Citizenship. Within each of these domains they have identified large areas of competency, each of which is broken down into progressions. Each learner that comes in is asked to go through about 4 weeks of getting to know themselves with a battery of assessments - personality, cognitive strengths, etc. while the school connects with past environments to get a sense of their history. The team of educators with the learner and any guardian that might exist then crafts an ""Urgency Story"" that becomes the starting place for the work, support and opportunities that learner gets.

Under Principal Cannon, North Edgecombe, a high-poverty, rural school in a district that struggles with teacher recruitment and retention, has embraced the Multi-Classroom Leadership model and is ""exceeding growth"" under the state definition. An Opportunity Culture school extends the reach of excellent teachers and their teams to more students, for more pay, within the school's recurring budget. Multi-Classroom Leadership is the foundation of an Opportunity Culture; multi-classroom leaders (MCLs) lead a small teaching team, providing instructional guidance and frequent, on-the-job development, while continuing to teach part of the time. The schools redesign schedules to provide additional school-day time for teacher planning, coaching and collaboration. MCLs typically lead the introduction of more effective curricula, instructional methods, classroom management and schoolwide culture-building. Accountable for the results of all students in the team, multi-classroom leaders earn substantial pay supplements, within the regular school budget. The school design teams reallocate school budgets to fund pay supplements permanently, in contrast to temporarily grant-funded programs.  ","Our mission is to provide students a liberating education that allows them to develop and pursue their passions, realize their life's purpose, remain resilient in the face of challenges, lead social and economic change in their family and communities, while positively impacting our world in their lifetime, creating a ripple for generations to come.

Using design thinking, we can uncover new ideas that allow us to disrupt for good -- making positive change with lasting impact.  One Stone learners build a deep understanding of complex, interdisciplinary, real-world issues through student-led design thinking challenges. Through these place-based and project-based learning experiences, students work collaboratively on meaningful, long-term projects. As a result, they learn how to plan and connect the dots between many small pieces of work to form and execute an entire project. This method inspires meaningful gratification, and encourages important forms of learning that come through collaboration. Among other things, students learn how to: manage ambitious projects, create teams with individual and group goals, work through multiple products and revisions, participate in student-led processes, and reflect on outcomes. This builds their critical thinking and reasoning skills, while allowing them to flex their creativity with a sensitivity to audience.  One Stone prioritizes growth over achievement through a highly personalized model. Advancement is based on students' mastery of knowledge and skills for particular academic content.

We believe people grow best when they're learning; That they learn best when they're creating; And that they create best when they're creating something which matters to them.  We believe these things are true regardless of age.  Despite all the differences between adults and youth, we believe the ways they learn and grow rhyme, that they're more similar than different.  Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to look at the most effective, creative workplaces, studios, and labs, and build such a place with youth, here in Somerville, grounded in two, basic activities: telling stories and building things with computers.  Our mission is to restore power, dignity, and play to youth.  We believe that to do that, youth can't be students, they can't be largely passive recipients of information.  They have to learn to identify problems and questions they care about and pursue them.  This is why at Powderhouse Studios, people mostly do projects.  When youth first join us, these projects come from their involvement in staff's ongoing work and the seminars staff put together around this work.  As youth get older, they spend more and more time articulating and developing projects of their own design.  By the time a young person leaves Powderhouse Studios, they'll be comfortable tackling year-long, 1,000 hour projects.  But to do that, at some point they must do a 500 hour project, and a 100 hour project, and so on, all the way down to whatever timescale they can manage when we first meet them.  But doing this well means we must support deep, and deeply individualized, work by young people.  To do this, we've gotten rid of traditional, subject-based classes and teaching positions.  Instead, the day is organized in three chunks: morning, lunch, and afternoon, 10AM to 5PM each day.  Staff work in tightly knit, cross-functional teams which stick together, managing mixed age cohorts of about thirty young people for years at a time.  And that's just the start.  Doing all this in a traditional district environment has proven quite hard.  We've had to deal with the many, many complications our model introduces. everything from union contracts to procurement. Throughout, people have told us we're crazy.  And what we're describing might sound crazy.  But it's how creative work has been done for centuries, from apprenticeships to MFA programs to kindergarten classrooms. Powderhouse Studios is our attempt to build on these traditions, making the road by walking it, bushwhacking trails as we work to invent a future of learning where doing new things isn't so hard.",,Early stage (0-3 years),Less than 2 years,,1,,1,1,1,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,1,"Yes, this is mostly accurate.",,3,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work of standards based reporting has allowed Red Bank to focus on authentic feedback in meaningful ways.

They worked closely with their local association to transition to a teacher-powered model in order to better serve students.

Reiche is located near a large refugee processing and over 40% of their students are ESL, and of those over 40% are IELD. Reiche has over 40 languages spoken at their school and a high rate of poverty with 78% FRL.   Reiche was Maine's first ""failing"" school. A progressive principal assigned to the school built leadership capacity and a highly collaborative culture among the staff. When the principal was reassigned, the Reiche teacher team worked with their union local to negotiate with their superintendent to assign an interim principal while they entered a year of exploration.   The team voted to convert to teacher-powered in 2011, something collaborative teams across the nation are beginning to explore. Today, the team selects three lead teachers on a rotating basis (each lead teacher serving four years) and every teacher participates in school-level decision-making.  With interest in opening the opportunity for other groups of teachers to replicate Reiche's model, the Maine legislature in 2013 passed, ""An Act to Develop a Grant Program to Establish a Teacher-led School Model."" This Bill encourages teacher-powered schools by allowing schools or districts to apply for grant monies to explore, develop and implement alternative governance structures.  Under the teacher team's leadership, they have turned around their status as Maine's first failing school and are now a model for success. Reiche has found that if students stay at their school over 3 years (mobility is certainly an issue with their population) then proficiency rates start to dramatically rise.  The teacher team has decided to use a community school model to serve the many needs of their students and families. This means that they partner with local organizations to provide services to their students and families, for example, the Opportunity Alliance in Portland which provides children and adults with mental health services.  ","Our motto is:  Student Centered - Teacher Powered.  We are a Teacher Led school, and as such we believe that if teachers are given the opportunity to step into leadership roles, that they will make the best decisions for the students to grow academically, socially and emotionally.

To this end, the school has created robust structures of support to empower students and staff to take learning to the next level. As an example, River Bluff uses a flexible modular schedule to leverage time and infuse multiple layers of student supports inside the school day. This approach supports equity by ensuring that all students have both the time and resources needed to achieve their goals. When you visit River Bluff, you are immediately struck by the human interactions; learning is authentic. Students are engaged in solving real world problems through student led inquiries which results in a level of engagement and empowerment that is exciting to see.     ","River Bluff, an innovative high school opened in 2013, a vision of leaders in Lexington County School District One who were charged to think in a new direction.   Embracing the challenge to create without boundaries, and to dream beyond traditional education, River Bluff opened as a new learning system centered on students.  As time inside and outside of class passes, students make decisions and manage their time through 25 modules of time (10 to 30 minutes each) within an innovative Flexible Modular Schedule.   A partnership with EL Education solidified the school's path toward student engaged learning experiences and assessment, where achievement is viewed in three dimensions: Mastery of Knowledge and Skills, Character and High Quality Work.  With five years of academic, arts and athletic achievements earned, the best is yet to come as their motto: ""Work hard. Get smart. Do good."" resonates with every student, staff member and stakeholder.   ","Following a successful bond referendum in 2008, our district formed a committee of educators to dream, research and design Schools of the Future -- NOW.  This committee created a draft document of the profile of a 21st Century graduate, and these design criteria became the catalyst for architecture firms to design and build our school in 2013. The 525,000 sq. ft. facility is nestled on 146 acres of land off of an historic and scenic highway in our town, with a core capacity of 2,500 students. The scope of the project included plans for LEED Silver Certification, as well as: flexible and collaborative learning spaces, a learning commons, performing arts center, coffee shop (Cafe 320) and cafeteria (River Cafe), dual gyms, media arts and music technology labs, wireless network capabilities, athletic facilities, an art gallery and student-run school store.   A Flexible Modular Schedule was designed to allow time to serve students and develop proactive habits through engaging them in regular class time and in Independent Learning Time (ILT), allowing the opportunity for students to choose time and space to engage in work and social interaction.  Engagement with the community in ""vision visits"" early on in the process allowed for school leaders to engage with families and community members in neighborhoods to discuss the new vision for learning. Our town is one of the fastest growing suburban communities in the southeast.  Though its size increases rapidly, the principal often comments, ""Our town is small with a bunch of people living in it.""  It is this culture that continues to attract families from near and far to our town.  A strong local healthcare system, quality schools, and a community near the banks of one of our state's largest man-made lakes continue to be a formula for exponential growth.  Predominantly represented by middle class families, parents seek local employment in areas such as: state government, Michelin, Nephron and many small businesses while the school system is one of the largest employers.  As new families come, their desire to see their children prepared in 21st century power skills and engaged in real world learning experiences continue to drive the decision making processes at our school. The journey has only just begun as continuous improvement and investment in culture continue to be our school's motivation.  An early partnership with EL Education grounded best practices into a common model of school-wide instructional delivery and provided the framework for an instructional design that focuses student achievement into three dimensions: Mastery of Knowledge and Skills, Character, and High Quality Student Work. The school's layout supports professional collaboration and inquiry as teachers are not confined to four-walled classrooms, but are provided large collaborative common areas with individual, open-air workstations.  Adjacent work areas for students invite both teacher and peer interaction at a moment's notice. Five years later, the results have been astounding: growing from an initial student population of 1,250 to now over 2,035; academic, athletic and fine arts' state and national awards abound.  Grounded in a culture of deep relationships, our school ""family"" believes in every person on campus, and truly seeks to develop the next greatest generation of citizen scholars into leaders who are inquisitive about their futures and engaged in problem-solving for their local to global communities.  In 2017-18 our school was honored as a finalist for the high school category of the SCASA Palmetto's Finalist Award, and our principal is the 2018 SCASA Secondary Principal of the Year.  In 2019 our principal was named NASSP National Principal of the Year and our school was awarded the coveted Palmetto's Finest award given to top high school in the state.

With the support of the Global Teaching Project, the Pilot Program provides comprehensive, wraparound services to students and teachers, including access to world-renowned subject matter experts, such as Yale University Physics Professor Meg Urry, as well as college-student tutors from leading institutions including MIT, Stanford, Yale, and Virginia, enabling Scott Central to leverage its existing resources to provide advanced courses to bright, but underserved students.  In addition to these unique human resources, the blended model also provides students the opportunity to participate in intensive, residential preparatory programs throughout the year at local MS-based universities including the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University.    The Global Teaching Project is excited to nominate Scott Central HS because of the tremendous efforts it is undertaking to provide historically underserved students access to AP courses.  Notwithstanding Scott Central's significant challenges, the blended learning model has made remarkable initial progress: classroom teachers are engaged and gaining both substantive and pedagogical experience; students are tackling rigorous subject matter (AP Physics 1 is the program's inaugural course) with initial performance data showing promising results; and, perhaps most importantly, students are beginning to reimagine themselves as part of a high-achieving, academically ambitious cohort.  As the model expands and continues to improve, the program will help to develop and prepare a pipeline of talented, high-achieving students from Mississippi's most rural and impoverished districts for post-secondary success.

183,59,Confirmed,Shawnee High School,Shawnee,Oklahoma,Shawnee Public Schools,Yes,Oklahoma State Department of Education,"Shawnee Public Schools has found an innovative way to help students and staff take care of their healthcare needs. Prior to the start of this innovation, Shawnee Public Schools staff members, students, and their families faced many challenges when trying to take care of health issues during the school day, including lost wages for parents and loss of instructional time for students. Staff and students who became sick while at school often could not be seen by a healthcare provider immediately, if at all. Beginning in 2018, Shawnee Public Schools partnered with the Team Clinics program to overcome these obstacles. With this partnership, Shawnee students and staff with health issues may go to the nurse's office and have a virtual doctor visit. In these virtual visits, the nurse connects online with a provider and, with special computer-connected equipment, the provider can check ears, noses, throats, lung sounds, and heartbeats. Often times, the patient receives a diagnosis and is treated within an hour or less. If the patient requires medication, the provider calls it into the pharmacy of the parent's choice.  Since the Team Clinic program began in September 2018, more than 110 students and staff have visited the virtual clinics. In that time, only one student and five teachers have been sent home due to illness. More than 90% of the virtual clinic visits have been for non-emergency cases, such as rashes, ear infections, and allergies, that do not require the student to miss class.","The core purpose of the school is to meet the needs of students and ensure that they are college, career and life ready when exiting our programs.  ","The core program, we do district wide, and is to provide wraparound services to students within the context of the school environment. This particular piece, medical clinics within school sites,  is centered around student and staff well being and health. We seek to bridge the gap to provide quick, immediate care for students in a way that is convenient for students and parents. Staff may also utilize the service to quickly get care for their own health condition that is a non emergency situation. We are able to test for flu, strep, and general infections in order to quickly get care for the individual without something dragging on for several days before being seen. We also partner with local and tribal agencies to connect the pieces for our greater area and keep local providers as part of the equation. We look to be expanding to mental health services in the future.

Three outstanding teachers were chosen to participate in a blended learning professional development program, and each teacher has designed a slightly unique model of blended learning to meet their students' needs. The teachers are situated within a traditional school but have found many ways to innovate. These three teacher-leaders are also preparing the rest of their colleagues to implement blended learning in their own classes in the fall. ","St. Alphonsus Catholic School recognizes the developmental uniqueness of each and every child. We believe excellence is best achieved through the partnership of school staff, parents and students. This partnership fosters academic excellence and physical achievement while helping children learn and live the Catholic faith.  St. Alphonsus Catholic School is proud to have been providing Catholic education in the Brooklyn Center area for over 50 years. We at St. Alphonsus place a high priority on the basics of education with faith formation being our main priority. All students are held to high academic and behavioral standards from staff members who believe all students can achieve. As a result, our students receive a well-rounded education.  The close relationship with our parish and the Redemptorist Community provides many opportunities for our students to celebrate our faith including: weekly student-led Masses, adoration, prayer services as well as visits from our parish priests.  At St. Alphonsus Catholic School, everyone belongs. We embrace our differences and work hard to build a community. Students benefit from our small class sizes. Being small means that each student is known and every family is valued. St. Alphonsus Catholic School is a safe place for our children to learn, to create and to expand their learning potential.  The school and parents are considered partners dedicated to ensuring a successful educational experience for the students. United, we will be able to provide the best possible experience for our students, an experience where students, teacher, staff and parents will have the opportunity to grow in their faith, as well as loving and respecting God, others and themselves.

The school has imbedded time during the day to work on Individual Career Academic Plans, a new statewide program that allows student-led career planning by ninth grade. The students who have interned return to school and express their excitement about particular professions or sometimes just the opposite. Stilwell is promoting exploration to expedite a career or save the student/parents wasted expense in the future. The businesses that have partnered with the school have been very pleased with the program, and the school has doubled participation from businesses within one year.","The core purpose for any school is to offer a quality, well rounded and equitable education experience to EVERY child. Stilwell Public Schools where EVERY child is known, valued and inspired to be  a Stilwell Indian- that is our motto!   We want to have a personal relationship with each child, to meet their individual needs whatever those may be and to offer a place where they individually have a sense of belonging and feel they can attain their educational goals no matter what those college/career goals may entail. We want to provide experiences/opportunities for them so they can ascertain what their true interests are and enable them to seek/participate in experiences that relate to those interests in order to create their own individualized pathway to college and/or career. Redefining how we provide such an education has been at the forefront of change at Stilwell Public Schools. Revision of scheduling and class offerings, added online learning, more project based learning, internships, partnerships with higher education, business/industry and community, dual enrollment, more concurrent enrollment are just a few of the changes that have taken place in order to ensure that students needs are met on an individual, personal basis. Our primary goal is to educate the children of our community in a way that is conducive to their learning, to meet each need by creating schedules and offerings that meet the educational needs of each student in order to ensure their individual success not just in their high school career but to set them on a path for their future career whether that be the workforce, trade school or college. ","I think I painted the big picture fairly well in narrative above but I would like to add that we have also focused on the social emotional needs of our students as well. We have many students with diverse SEL needs. We strive to offer wrap around services and in house counseling provided through grant funds that we have received. The more we learn about trauma informed instruction the better we become at addressing the SEL well being of our students. Our district is very high poverty with a 42% child poverty rate, we are a rural area and a CEP school district which means all our students eat for free because our percentage of economically disadvantaged students is very high- and these are just a few statistics for you. So we realize that we are the hope for a lot of our students, if we do not put forth our very best efforts each and every day, if we do not keep learning and striving to provide the very best educational experience for these individual students then who will? We continue to seek out hands on, project based, applicable experiences/opportunities for our students so they may be more than adequately prepared for the workforce, trade school or college. We are fully aware that if we change one life of a student by offering them an opportunity or experience to see themselves in an occupation or a position it can actually change a whole family in our community. If that student can SEE themselves in that role or position they are more likely to be successful and feel they can belong to that community.

Every year at Taft Elementary School begins with an introductory poll of all kindergarten and first-grade students, asking one question: What do you want to be when you grow up? Taft's Principal Terrence Lee told the Illinois State Board of Education: ""Let's say a kid says they want to be Batman, and typically we'd say, 'No that's not a career.' But if you think about it, Batman's a millionaire, an entrepreneur, a businessman, and he saves people. We can tap into some of those things to say, 'How did Bruce Wayne become Batman?' Later on, we can lead this child into a career strand in human services or business management."" Defined STEM includes quarterly inquiry-based science, technology, engineering, and math projects. Students follow the Goal, Role, Audience, Situation, and Product (GRASP) model, which offers a rubric for assessment and self-assessment of learning proficiency for each project. These projects are guided by the career focus, which branches out into specific career strands for each grade to explore. Project-based learning is supplemented by visits from professionals working in those particular fields, as well as field trips and real-world learning opportunities. Students begin using a program called Naviance in the sixth grade. Naviance is a learner-centered, personalized college and career readiness tool that helps students explore the career paths that best suit their working styles and passions.

AAL prepares students for college and the modern workplace via personalized learning, allowing students to learn at a pace and modality that best fits his learning style and capitalizes on his strengths. AAL's instructional model integrates the following components: 1. LSAE Model. In this model, teachers deliver a lesson to all students for the first 20-30 minutes of class. They then sort students into four groups (Learning, Securing, Accelerating, Enriching) based on their demonstrated mastery of the skill. Depending on their needs, students receive small-group instruction or auxiliary lessons to extend or accelerate their learning, either via online learning or with a learning coach. 2. Student Learning Profiles and Plans. At the beginning of the school year, the school works with students and parents to develop a student learning profile, a document that includes students' past achievement data, strengths, areas for growth, and interests. Teachers are tasked with using the student learning profiles to develop student learning plans, customized strategies that are used to inform instruction of the student within the LSAE model. 3. Habits of Success and Learning How to Learn. The school has developed a set of ""Habits of Success"" that they hope to instill in students, including ""be at school and on time,"" ""strive for accuracy,"" ""respect for others,"" ""perseverance,"" etc. The school is also using a self-assessment rubric once a week to help students learn how to learn, measuring learning skills such as ""I choose the right learning environment,"" ""I am resourceful in finding assistance.""",Our core purpose is to significantly narrow achievement gaps and prepare students for a Year 2030 workplace and world.,"The school's instructional model relies on a change in how schools work.

It is an unscreened school, so students come from all over NYC, and enter with a wide variety of abilities. Students are asked to approach their learning as a process they own, which involves hands-on, collaborative and independent work, targeted coaching on skills, and iteration using both design thinking and mastery as frameworks to understand the criteria for success, and the process they will use to achieve it. Classes are lively and project-based, and the school offers a much-used maker space. This model works for a diverse student body, who report feeling more confident, more cognizant of how to make progress, more able to use questioning and design thinking to support their learning, and more aware of their own capabilities.

UA Maker is a highly diverse school in NYC, both with regard to race/ethnicity, and socio-economic status. With a maker/design-thinking approach, and a competency-based model, the school has found ways to meet their students where they are, and successfully prepare them for post-secondary life. 

UA Maker, within The Urban Assembly Network, believes the world needs problem solvers who can find and solve challenges to create positive change. UA Maker aims to empower students not only to be successful, adaptive citizens of the future, but also to create that future through design thinking and innovation.

How? By building trusting relationships and giving students unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead. Students at WLA take rigorous core classes, enriched by real-world experiences and access to experts, as well as student-selected projects and electives, all combined with the latest in technology and innovation. All WLA students take Computer Science and get hands-on experience with emerging technology, including virtual/augmented reality. WLA combines civic education, social justice education, and support for students as they explore who they are and where they want to go in life. Driven by an approach to teaching and learning that is both ""high tech"" and ""high touch,"" WLA is making a true difference for students in Washington, D.C., and beyond.

WLA's instructional model was designed to optimize personalization and rigor of instruction given each content area and the current state of the edtech market (both content and tools).  In practice, this means that instruction looks different from subject to subject. In content-heavy subjects, i.e. History, WLA will utilize a flipped classroom model. In subjects that require both remediation and skills develop, i.e Math and English, WLA will implement a two-day split with one section focused on grade-level content/instruction and the second section focused on remediation. The specifics of each are listed below, but each subject implements different tools and teacher practices to maximize results.

The school implements a student-centered approach aligned to Farmington's improvement design. Curriculum, instruction, programming, and assessment are aligned to purpose-driven, socially-constructed, mastery-based and self-directed learning. One specific example to share is FLEX time. FLEX time is a challenge and support block developed by WWUES teachers. FLEX time provides students with a menu of options to select from that are both teacher and student directed. Choice is a key element of the design and student-engaged assessment practices drive a self-directed model of challenge and support within this innovative model. Two years after this teacher-led innovation was developed, Farmington is implementing this design across K-8 schools. Clear standards and data driven decision-making are a key feature of WWUES' student-centered approach. All standards for the week are clearly articulated and the student work from the week provides the body of evidence that demonstrates student progress towards those standards. While many of the offerings are based on academic standards, they are not exclusively so. Sessions can focus on learner mindset, Vision of the Graduate skills, organization, or any other social/emotional or executive functioning skills that teachers identify as an area of need. Student self-reflection, voice and choice is key to this daily block. Students are given tools and feedback to assess their own strengths and needs and are trusted to make wise choices about how to most effectively make use of the time and support they are provided. Students who have met the standards are given the opportunity to exceed the standard by working on the standard at a more advanced level. WWUES implements a mastery-based approach to empower students as leaders of their own learning. Farmington's mastery-based principles are implemented in all classrooms. ","The West Woods community consists of approximately 650 students in grades five and six. We believe fostering positive relationships among students, parents, staff and faculty is the cornerstone of a successful school community and we aspire to develop relationships that help students become engaged, resourceful and self-directed learners who have compassion for all the members of their community. In citing research by cognitive scientist Antonio Damasio, New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote ""...children learn from people they love, and that love in this context means willing the good of another, and offering active care for the whole person."" This statement, by Brooks, we believe epitomizes what being a member of the West Woods community is all about.  We believe that developing relationships are what matter most for students to succeed.         Our innovative practices are grounded in guiding students to become ""leaders of their own learning"" to achieve the district's Vision of the Graduate in an ever-changing world.  Through a flexible, mastery-based approach students are provided with the structures and feedback to make decisions about their next level of work.

That partnership gave birth to the Township High School District 214 Career Pathways program. District 214 prepares its students for college and careers through experiential learning in 16 career clusters and 44 career pathways. The Career Pathways program currently serves more than 12,000 students from six comprehensive high schools, including Wheeling High School, and four specialized learning programs. District 214 purposefully eliminated the distinction between core courses and technical and career education courses. As many as 85 percent of District 214's students graduate having taken a college course, and two-thirds have completed nine semester hours of college credit by the time they graduate, an opportunity for considerable savings in tuition costs. Ninety-five percent of the district's students identify a career area of interest by graduation. Students have logged more than 2 million hours of workplace learning. The Educator Prep career pathway has served as a statewide model for addressing the teacher shortage. The teaching cluster begins with a sequence of high school courses that provide students an early feel for education as a career. Students who continue with the program earn early college credits and spend several days a week teaching lessons in actual K-12 classrooms under the close supervision of a master teacher. Students then can continue in the Educator Prep program with a postsecondary partner and earn a bachelor's degree and a teaching license. The district provides a network of supports for students while in college to increase the likelihood they graduate and become teachers. The district guarantees each student first access to interview for district teaching jobs. ","Wheeling High School is a comprehensive STEM school where students and teacher are empowered to explore, care, connect, and grow in a changing world.  Our purpose is to provide students an educational experience tailored to their career aspirations that consists of a sequence of courses that result in early college credit and work-place experiences.  We are redefining what it means to be college and career ready.  ","Wheeling High School operates on a nine period day which allows for students to pursue their interests in various career pathways such as Healthcare, Engineering and Manufacturing, Law, Aerospace, and Education.  Our teachers utilize a variety of technologies to allow students to access information and learn in a variety of ways.  We are increasingly expanding our blended learning opportunities to students seeking a more flexible learning environment.  Our partnerships with higher education and private businesses has allowed us to provide early college credit and job internships for over 90% of our graduating class consistently over the last several years.

Project-based learning was an evolution of the school's model and they became an EL Education site in 2006. The day starts with a skill-based ""Brain Training"" class followed by mixed-age Crew (akin to advisory). For the rest of the day, 10-12th graders work on one or two projects. Each project is 4-6 weeks in length. Freshmen have a more structured schedule, and educators work to help them acclimate to the project-based work to come. As a student approaches graduation, he or she will spend time off-campus in an internship or engaged in college classes. Students also design their own Capstone Projects. Projects integrate fieldwork, guest experts, and authentic audiences that help bring curriculum to life. The hands-on nature of the school's approach reflects a workplace environment that will prepare students for the future. As students develop products and presentations, they learn content while gaining academic and 21st-century skills like collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving.

Students share their learning journey with their parents during student-led parent conferences. Parents learn strategies to help their child via data-driven personalized parent engagement nights. We focus on the following pillars: campus and classroom culture, data-driven instruction, student agency, competency based progression and rigor.
